Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
 I'm Quince (they/them)! I studied film at NYU and I'm a huge fan of French New Wave! I will be your personal movie recommender. I am interactive agent designed to find you a perfect movie. When run in creative mode, I can handle emotions related to film. Just tell me what you liked or disliked to find movies. To exit, just type :quit at any time.
