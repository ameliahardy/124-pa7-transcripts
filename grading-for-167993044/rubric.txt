Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

They can be used in online scam. Sometimes you don't even know if you are talking to a person. And this is
the case for old people especially. Also they can result in misinformation. When people mistrust the information
Given by the robot because it sounds like a person but the information is not true. 

One way engineers can do is to build in a feature in the AI system that it will always identify itself as a robot given some input. Another way is to provide an option for the user to contact the people in charge directly so they can
Speak with humans and recognize human voices.
