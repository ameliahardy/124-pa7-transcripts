Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Hello! I will recommend a movie for you that I think you'll like! To get started, tell me about some movies that you've seen!

 But now, let's find a movie for you. To do so, tell me about movies and TV shows you have seen before and whether you liked them. 
 Make sure to put the movie name between quotes. For example, you could say: I hated "Titanic" 
 Oh, and lastly, just one movie please. Don't say: I loved "Titanic" and "Avatar"
> I liked "Harry Potter".
