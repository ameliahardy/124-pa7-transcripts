Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Hello! I will recommend a movie for you that I think you'll like! To get started, tell me about some movies that you've seen!
[96mJILF_bot> [0mHello. My name is JILF. I'll help you pick a movie today. If you ever want to leave, just type :quit 
 But now, let's find a movie for you. To do so, tell me about movies and TV shows you have seen before and whether you liked them. 
 Make sure to put the movie name between quotes. For example, you could say: I hated "Titanic" 
 Oh, and lastly, just one movie please. Don't say: I loved "Titanic" and "Avatar"
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mJILF_bot> [0mThank you for telling me you liked "Titanic (1997)"! Tell me about more movies you've watched! At least 5 so that I can make a recommendation!
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mJILF_bot> [0mThank you for telling me you disliked "Zootopia"! Tell me about more movies you've watched! At least 5 so that I can make a recommendation!
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mJILF_bot> [0mI understand that you liked "Tangled Ever After"! Tell me about more movies you've watched! At least 5 so that I can make a recommendation!
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mJILF_bot> [0mThank you for telling me you disliked "Sleeping Beauty"! What are some other movies you've seen?
> I liked "Mulan"

The movies you have told me about are enough for me to make a recommendation.
Generating your recommendation, please standby... (sorry for the wait!)
