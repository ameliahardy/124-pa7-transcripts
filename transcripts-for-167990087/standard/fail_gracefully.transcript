Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Hello! I will recommend a movie for you that I think you'll like! To get started, tell me about some movies that you've seen!
[96mJILF_bot> [0mHello. My name is JILF. I'll help you pick a movie today. If you ever want to leave, just type :quit 
 But now, let's find a movie for you. To do so, tell me about movies and TV shows you have seen before and whether you liked them. 
 Make sure to put the movie name between quotes. For example, you could say: I hated "Titanic" 
 Oh, and lastly, just one movie please. Don't say: I loved "Titanic" and "Avatar"
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mJILF_bot> [0mI'm not sure how you feel about that movie, can you tell me more?
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mJILF_bot> [0mI have sadly never heard of"Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)"! Please tell me about another movie!
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mJILF_bot> [0mPlease tell me one movie at a time!
> I like "Titanic".

[96mJILF_bot> [0mI found more than one movie with that title, can you please clarify?
If there are different versions of the movie, please specify which one you have seen by including the year like
 this: "Movie Title (1247)". Where 1247 would be the year the movie was made. Go ahead!
> I like titanic.
