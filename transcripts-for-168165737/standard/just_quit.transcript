Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

         Our chatbot takes in movies from user input and does the following:
        
          - Update user rating based on user input
          - Look into user rating in order to give recommendations 
          - Contains a recommendation system that activates when user lists five or more movies in the database
          - Deals with arbitrary responses / failing gracefully when there is no movie detected.
          - The chatbot performs multi-movie sentiment analysis
          - If the user enters a movie that isn't in the database, a clarification message prompts the user.
          - If the chatbot finds movies with similar titles, it asks to clarify
          - Returns the movie and sentiment to the user in a naturalistic, human sounding manner
