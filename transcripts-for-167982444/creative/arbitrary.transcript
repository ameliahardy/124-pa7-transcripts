Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Our chatbot is pirate themed and ready to bring you on board. It passes all
         of the starter mode tests along with some additional creative functionality. 
         You can type movies you liked or didn't like, and after 5 movies, the bot 
         will give you a recommendation. Have fun!"
