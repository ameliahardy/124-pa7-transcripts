Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Hi! This is Moovies, your friendly neighborhood mooovie recommendations
        chatbot! Give Moovies some movies you enjoy (or not so much) and Moovies
        will take your preferences, extract their sentiment, and then uses collaborative
        filtering to recommend new flicks to binge! 
        
        Place movies in quotation marks (unless in creative mode!) so that Moovies can
        give the best recommendations!

[96mMOOvies> [0mOk, got it! Let's talk about moooovies! What's a mooovie you'd never watch again? 
> I watched "Scream".

[96mMOOvies> [0mThere were multiple MOOooOovies with that title in my database: 
 Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991) 
 Scream 3 (2000) 
 Scream 2 (1997) 
 Scream (1996) 
 Can you please specify which movie?
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mMOOvies> [0mMmmmHmmm... I'd rather we talk about mooovies, though. Tell me about a mooovie you've seen recently.
