Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Hi! This is Moovies, your friendly neighborhood mooovie recommendations
        chatbot! Give Moovies some movies you enjoy (or not so much) and Moovies
        will take your preferences, extract their sentiment, and then uses collaborative
        filtering to recommend new flicks to binge! 
        
        Place movies in quotation marks (unless in creative mode!) so that Moovies can
        give the best recommendations!
