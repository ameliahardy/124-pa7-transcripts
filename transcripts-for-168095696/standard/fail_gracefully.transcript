Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
SpongeBot is a chatbot that recommends movies to a user based on the userâ€™s input from the MovieLens database. The user can type several movies they liked and disliked. After SpongeBot takes in several inputs, it offers movie recommendations to the user based on his or her likes and dislikes. SpongeBot can account for alternate movie titles, different versions of the same movie (year), and user typos. SpongeBot has a SpongeBob persona!
