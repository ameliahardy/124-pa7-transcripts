Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Looking for some new movies to watch? With just a quick conversation with 
        Mr. Krabs, a movie recommender chatbot, you can learn about several films 
        new and old to add to your watchlist.

        For the best user experience, please use short, specific sentences, and be 
        patient if he asks you to clarify anything! For example the entry "I really
        enjoyed watching "The Nightmare Before Christmas" movie." is formatted well.
        Additionally, please only input one movie at a time and put the movie's name 
        in quotation marks.
