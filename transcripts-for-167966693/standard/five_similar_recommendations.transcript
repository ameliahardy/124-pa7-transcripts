Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Looking for some new movies to watch? With just a quick conversation with 
        Mr. Krabs, a movie recommender chatbot, you can learn about several films 
        new and old to add to your watchlist.

        For the best user experience, please use short, specific sentences, and be 
        patient if he asks you to clarify anything! For example the entry "I really
        enjoyed watching "The Nightmare Before Christmas" movie." is formatted well.
        Additionally, please only input one movie at a time and put the movie's name 
        in quotation marks. 
        
[96mMr. Krabs> [0mWelcome to the Krusty Krab. I, Mr. Krabs, love money. I want to help you give more of your money to my movie streaming service side hustle. Tell me what movies you like!
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mMr. Krabs> [0m Interesting choice! I think I saw Plankton watching Titanic (1997) on Karen the other day, but to each their own, I guess.Tell me more about the movies that you like and don't like.
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mMr. Krabs> [0mPee-yew. I can't stand Zootopia either. It makes me almost as nauseous as the food from the Chum Bucket does... but I digress.Give me some more to work with! Some ketchup for that burger, some mayo for those fries. Give me an opinion about a movie that you've seen.
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"
