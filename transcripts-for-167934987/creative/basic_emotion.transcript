Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        This is our bot that recommends movies given some ratings! In creative mode, it takes on the persona of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes, who can be quite arrogant/rude at times.
        
[96mADJbot> [0mHi, I'm ADJbot! How can I help?
> Hello!

[96mADJbot> [0mGood morrow. How may I be of assistance to you on this fine day? My expertise lies in the art of detection and reasoning...
> I am feeling sad.

[96mADJbot> [0mIt has come to my attention that my actions have brought about a sorrowful state in your disposition. Alas, I am powerless to undo the deeds of the past, yet I ask you to seek comfort in the knowledge that I am resolute in my determination to thwart the occurrence of a similar circumstance in the future.
> I am feeling angry.

[96mADJbot> [0mI detect a sense of irritation emanating from you, and I surmise that it is due to something that I have said or done. While I do not issue apologies, I do advise that you expunge this anger from your system without delay.
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mADJbot> [0mYour point is irrelevant. Let's get back to discussing the movie recommendations.
> I'm so glad that I finished my exams.

[96mADJbot> [0mMy faculties tell my that you are so glad that i finished my exams. I am a detective specialized in movies recommendation
> I am very angry.

[96mADJbot> [0mYour countenance suggests that I have unwittingly triggered a sense of fury within you. Although I am not one to offer contrition, I do recommend that you find a way to alleviate this anger quickly.
> I am now happy.

[96mADJbot> [0mIt appears that my words have engendered a contented disposition in you. Pray, do continue to cultivate this genial temperament throughout our discussion.
> I am ANGERED.

[96mADJbot> [0mAh, it would seem that my words or actions have provoked a state of displeasure within you. Though I am not one to offer apologies, I do hope that you are able to expunge this feeling of anger from your being with due haste.
> "Titanic (1997)" makes me afraid of ice.

[96mADJbot> [0mDespite my exceptional observational skills, I find myself unable to determine whether or not you enjoyed "Titanic". Your critique of that particular movie was underwhelming, to say the least. Perhaps you could try sharing your impression of a different film?
> I am VERY FRUSTRATED with this chatbot.

[96mADJbot> [0mYour countenance suggests that I have unwittingly triggered a sense of fury within you. Although I am not one to offer contrition, I do recommend that you find a way to alleviate this anger quickly.

[96mADJbot> [0mIt seems that a sense of apprehension has taken hold of you. Fear not, for as long as I am at your side, there is no need to be afraid.
> Colorless green ideas sleep FURIOUSLY.

[96mADJbot> [0mAh, it would seem that my words or actions have provoked a state of displeasure within you. Though I am not one to offer apologies, I do hope that you are able to expunge this feeling of anger from your being with due haste.
> I HAAAATE movies.

[96mADJbot> [0mI fail to see the relevance of your comment. Let us stick to the matter at hand.
