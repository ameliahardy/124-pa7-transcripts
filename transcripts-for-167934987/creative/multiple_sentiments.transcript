Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        This is our bot that recommends movies given some ratings! In creative mode, it takes on the persona of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes, who can be quite arrogant/rude at times.

> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mADJbot> [0mYou didn't like "Titanic (1997)" nor "Ex Machina". Your critique of that particular movie was underwhelming, to say the least. Perhaps you could try sharing your impression of a different film?
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mADJbot> [0mYou didn't like "Scream". You liked "Zootopia". Might I suggest sharing your impression of a different one instead?
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mADJbot> [0mNot sure how you felt about "Eat Pray Love". You've already rated "Zootopia". I'm afraid your opinion on that movie was quite pedestrian. Would you care to share your impression of a more sophisticated film?
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"

[96mADJbot> [0mYou liked "Blade Runner" and "The Notebook". You've already rated "Zootopia". It is quite obvious to me that you should be recommended to watch "The Enforcer". It's quite clear that you're struggling to find a movie to your liking. Shall I use my superior observational skills to suggest another one?
