Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        This is our bot that recommends movies given some ratings! In creative mode, it takes on the persona of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes, who can be quite arrogant/rude at times.
        
[96mADJbot> [0mHi, I'm ADJbot! How can I help?
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mADJbot> [0mBased on my observations, it is clear that you have an affinity for "Blade Runner". Your critique of that particular movie was underwhelming, to say the least. Perhaps you could try sharing your impression of a different film?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mADJbot> [0mDespite my exceptional observational skills, I find myself unable to determine whether or not you enjoyed "Terminator Salvation". Might I suggest sharing your impression of a different one instead?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mADJbot> [0mEven with my extensive knowledge of human behavior, I am unable to ascertain whether or not you had a liking for "Titanic". I'm afraid your opinion on that movie was quite pedestrian. Would you care to share your impression of a more sophisticated film?
> I liked it.

[96mADJbot> [0mI'm afraid you'll have to be more specific. Which one are you referring to, or are you incapable of providing clear details?

[96mADJbot> [0mI'm afraid your lack of specificity is hindering our progress. Please provide another movie for consideration.
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mADJbot> [0mYour point is irrelevant. Let's get back to discussing the movie recommendations.
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mADJbot> [0mDespite my best efforts to observe your behavior, I cannot determine with certainty whether or not you had a fondness for "Zootopia". Your assessment of that movie was quite disappointing. Perhaps you should try sharing your impression of a different film, unless you want to continue to showcase your lack of taste.
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mADJbot> [0mMy powers of deduction are not infallible, and I cannot say for certain whether or not you had a preference for "Ex Machina". It seems your ability to provide insightful critiques is lacking. Maybe you should share your impression of a different movie instead?
> :quit
[96mADJbot> [0mThank you for using ADJbot!
