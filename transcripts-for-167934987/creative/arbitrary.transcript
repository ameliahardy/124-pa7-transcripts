Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        This is our bot that recommends movies given some ratings! In creative mode, it takes on the persona of Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock Holmes, who can be quite arrogant/rude at times.

[96mADJbot> [0mWelcome. What brings you to consult with me today? I am proficient in the field of detection and have a keen eye for details...
> I am a robot too.

[96mADJbot> [0mI noticed that you are a robot too. In my capacity as a detective, I can predict which movies would suit your taste
> What is your name?

[96mADJbot> [0mMy sincerest apologies, for my current lack of insight cannot clearly say what my name is
> Do you know anything about books?

[96mADJbot> [0mYour point is irrelevant. Let's get back to discussing the movie recommendations.
> I loved Dan Jurafsky's latest lecture.

[96mADJbot> [0mI fail to see the relevance of your comment. Let us stick to the matter at hand.

[96mADJbot> [0mUnfortunately, I do not have the ability to speak french

[96mADJbot> [0mYour observation is a waste of time. We are here to exchange movie suggestions.

[96mADJbot> [0mI'm afraid you'll have to be more specific. Which one are you referring to, or are you incapable of providing clear details?
