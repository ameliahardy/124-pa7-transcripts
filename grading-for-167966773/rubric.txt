Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?


The anthropomorphizing of chatbot systems has major implications for various industries
which demonstrates the need responsible use, development, and deployment. There is clear
potential for use cases where users prefer human-esque responses like customer services, 
entertainment, and generative therapy. However for each use-case, the system and its 
larger effects should be properly examined before it is publicly available, as there is 
also potential for mass psychological and sociological consequences from attachment to 
artificual intelligence.

It is difficult for engineers to ensure that users can easily distinguish a chatbot as 
artificial, but preventing chatbots from exhibiting emotions and human traits helps.
Additionaly designers can ensure that chatbots lack visual representations and that
interactions with chatbots do not appear natural.
