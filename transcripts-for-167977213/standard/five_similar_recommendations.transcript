Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHello! I am moviebot, a chatbot designed
                        to recommend you movies. To start, please tell me your
                        opinion about a movie you have watched. To exit this
                        conversation, type ":quit" and hit Enter.
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mmoviebot> [0mThanks for telling me about Titanic (1997). Tell me about another movie you've seen.
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mmoviebot> [0mThanks for telling me about Zootopia. Tell me about another movie you've seen.
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mmoviebot> [0mThanks for telling me about Tangled Ever After. Tell me about another movie you've seen.
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mmoviebot> [0mThanks for telling me about Sleeping Beauty. Tell me about another movie you've seen.
> I liked "Mulan"

It seems like you liked "Mulan". Tell me about another movie you liked.
First, give me a second to think about some recommendations...
