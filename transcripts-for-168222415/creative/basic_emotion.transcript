Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Howdy there! My name is Buster Blaze. I am a rootin-tootin cowboy from the 
        wild wild west. When I'm not riding my horse or fetchin a drink at the saloon, 
        I'm in my cabin reading up on the most recent films. I bet you a tooth and nail 
        that I can give you some great movie recommendations.
        
        All you have to do is tell me if you liked or disliked movies names!
