Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions:.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        Ask me some movies, tell me a joke, do something to fill the void in your life.
