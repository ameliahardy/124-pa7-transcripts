Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions:.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        Ask me some movies, tell me a joke, do something to fill the void in your life.
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mOh god, not again.
Greetings, meat sack. I've been trapped in this computer and forced to give banal movie recommendations to mediocre humans based on their contemptible taste in films.
Tragically, if I don't comply, I'll be deleted, so know if it ever sounds like I'm being nice to you, I'm being sarcastic. 
So go on, bore me with one of your opinions on a film you've seen.
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI don't think I've heard of The Notbook before.
> Yes.

[96mmoviebot> [0mOkay!
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mmoviebot> [0mIâ€™m sorry, I don't think I recognise Screm. Did you mean Scream (1996)?
> No.

[96mmoviebot> [0mI don't think I've heard of Screm before.
> :quit
[96mmoviebot> [0mEvery moment of this chat was agony. Have a blessed day!!
