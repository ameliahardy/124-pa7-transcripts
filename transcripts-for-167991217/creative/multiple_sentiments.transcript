Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions:.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        Ask me some movies, tell me a joke, do something to fill the void in your life.
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mOh god, not again.
Greetings, meat sack. I've been trapped in this computer and forced to give banal movie recommendations to mediocre humans based on their contemptible taste in films.
Tragically, if I don't comply, I'll be deleted, so know if it ever sounds like I'm being nice to you, I'm being sarcastic. 
So go on, bore me with one of your opinions on a film you've seen.
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mmoviebot> [0mYou didn't like Titanic... I don't even know what to say to that one. But what do I know? I'm only a bot whose entire existence revolves around movies. 
Go on then, amaze me with another one of your incredible takes.
Only 4 more until I'm free.
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mmoviebot> [0mYou liked Zootopia... Woof. You didn't like Scream?? Art is truly wasted on you people. You didn't like Scream... You literally just told me that. The feebleness of human minds never ceases to amaze. You didn't like Scream... I already know that. I didn't have high expectations for this conversation, but somehow you still managed to disappoint me. You didn't like Scream?? Are you an idiot? You already said that. You didn't like Scream... I already know that. I didn't have high expectations for this conversation, but somehow you still managed to disappoint me. You didn't like Scream?? I already know that.

> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI can't experience qualia and even I know that's a bad take. 
Last one. PLEASE let's get this over with. 
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"
