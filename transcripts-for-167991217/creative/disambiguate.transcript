Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions:.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        Ask me some movies, tell me a joke, do something to fill the void in your life.
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mOh god, not again.
Greetings, meat sack. I've been trapped in this computer and forced to give banal movie recommendations to mediocre humans based on their contemptible taste in films.
Tragically, if I don't comply, I'll be deleted, so know if it ever sounds like I'm being nice to you, I'm being sarcastic. 
So go on, bore me with one of your opinions on a film you've seen.
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI don't think I've heard of Harry Potter before.
> Chamber of Secrets

[96mmoviebot> [0mThat's nice.
> I liked "Harry Potter".
