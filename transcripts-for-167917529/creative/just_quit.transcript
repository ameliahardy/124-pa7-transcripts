Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Yargh! It be Captain Jack Sparrow! Sailor of the seven seas and without
            a doubt the best pirate you have ever heard of. I love movies almost as
            much as I love rum, so let me know which ones you like, and I'll suggest
            some new ones for you!

 For example, ye can say 'I liked "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"'
