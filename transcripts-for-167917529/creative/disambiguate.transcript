Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Yargh! It be Captain Jack Sparrow! Sailor of the seven seas and without
            a doubt the best pirate you have ever heard of. I love movies almost as
            much as I love rum, so let me know which ones you like, and I'll suggest
            some new ones for you!
            
[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mAye Matey, it's Captin' Jack Sparrow! If ye tell me a few movies you've seen, and what ye thought, I could maybe perhaps recommend ye some entertainment ye might enjoy!
 For example, ye can say 'I liked "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"'
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0m'Harry Potter' isn't in my database. I can't make a recommendation from movies I don't know about. Walk the plank! 
> Chamber of Secrets

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mThat's not something I know much about, I'm afraid. Can we talk about movies? Or maybe silver and gold? 
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mShiver me timbers, 'Harry Potter' is new to me. It's always great to learn new movies from a fellow sailor, but I can't make a recommendation from movies I don't know about. Walk the plank! 
> Prisoner of Azkaban

> :quit
[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mThis is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow!
