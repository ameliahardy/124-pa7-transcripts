Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Yargh! It be Captain Jack Sparrow! Sailor of the seven seas and without
            a doubt the best pirate you have ever heard of. I love movies almost as
            much as I love rum, so let me know which ones you like, and I'll suggest
            some new ones for you!
            
[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mAye Matey, it's Captin' Jack Sparrow! If ye tell me a few movies you've seen, and what ye thought, I could maybe perhaps recommend ye some entertainment ye might enjoy!
 For example, ye can say 'I liked "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl"'
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mShiver me timbers, 'Blade Runner' is one of my favorites. 
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mScallywag! I can't tell whether you enjoyed 'Terminator Salvation'. Can you rephrase that?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mScallywag! I can't tell whether you enjoyed 'Titanic (1997)'. Can you rephrase that?

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mYe must have had too much rum! I can't understand ye 
> I watched "Scream".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mBlast, I'm not sure if you liked 'Scream'. Can you say something else about it?
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mOh, I see.

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mScallywag! I can't tell whether you enjoyed 'Zootopia'. Can you rephrase that?Would ye like to hear a recommendation?
