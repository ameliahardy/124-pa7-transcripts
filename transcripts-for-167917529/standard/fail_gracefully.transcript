Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Hello! I'm Bud, your local movie-recommending chatbot! If you'd like to 
            have some suggestions of movies you want to watch, I can help you out!
            Just let me know a few movies you already know you like, and I'll 
            suggest some new ones for you! 
            
[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mIf you tell me a few movies you've seen, and what you thought, I can recommend you some ones you might like!
 For example, you can say 'I liked "Titanic"'
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mOh no, I can't tell whether you enjoyed 'Titanic (1997)'. Can you rephrase that?
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0m'Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)' isn't in my database, weirdly. I can't make a recommendation from movies I don't know about. Sorry about that! 
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mNice, you enjoyed 'Titanic (1997)' and 'Scream' and '10 Things I Hate About You'. 
> I like "Titanic".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mCool, I also liked 'Titanic'! 
> I like titanic.

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mHrm, I don't know how to respond to that! 
> I like "titanic".

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0m'titanic' isn't in my database, weirdly. I can't make a recommendation from movies I don't know about. Sorry about that! 
> I like 10 things I hate about you.

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mSorry, that doesn't sound like you're telling me about a movie you've seen.
> Howdy.

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mI'm just a movie-loving chatbot; I don't know much about the world! 
> ...

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mHrm, I don't know how to respond to that! 
> I saw "Titanic (1220)"
