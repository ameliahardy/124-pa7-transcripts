Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Hello! I'm Bud, your local movie-recommending chatbot! If you'd like to 
            have some suggestions of movies you want to watch, I can help you out!
            Just let me know a few movies you already know you like, and I'll 
            suggest some new ones for you! 
            
[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mIf you tell me a few movies you've seen, and what you thought, I can recommend you some ones you might like!
 For example, you can say 'I liked "Titanic"'
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mNice, you enjoyed 'Titanic (1997)'. 
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mCool, I'll keep in mind you didn't enjoy 'Zootopia'. 
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mAwesome, I love a fellow 'Tangled Ever After' fan! 
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mOk, I won't recommend movies like 'Sleeping Beauty'. 
> I liked "Mulan"

[96mJack, Movie Expert> [0mNice, you enjoyed 'Mulan'. Would you like to hear a recommendation?
> yes
