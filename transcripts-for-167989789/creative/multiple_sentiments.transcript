[96miHOP> [0mHi! I am iHOP. How can I make your day a little hoppy, my dear friend?
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96miHOP> [0mOkey dokey, you didn't like "Titanic (1997)" and you didn't like "Ex Machina". I have long ears that help me hear very well, tell me about some other movies that you liked or hated!
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96miHOP> [0mAlrighty, you liked "Zootopia" and you didn't like "Scream". I have long ears that help me hear very well, tell me about some other movies that you liked or hated!
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96miHOP> [0mOkey dokey, you didn't like "Zootopia" and you didn't like "Eat Pray Love". I think you might also want to watch "Little Manhattan (2005)". Can I hook you up with some more carrot recommendations?
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"
