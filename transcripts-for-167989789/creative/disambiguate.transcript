[96miHOP> [0mHi! I am iHOP. How can I make your day a little hoppy, my dear friend?
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96miHOP> [0mHold on to your carrots, bunny, we've got multiple movies named "Harry Potter". I found "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (a.k.a. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone) (2001)" and "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)" and "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (2004)" and "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005)" and "Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix (2007)" and "Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (2009)" and "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 (2010)" and "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)" in my carrotbox. I'm feeling a bit lost in the rabbit hole, which one did you mean?
> Chamber of Secrets

[96miHOP> [0mOkey dokey, you liked "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (2002)". Good choice! I give you my seal of approval.
