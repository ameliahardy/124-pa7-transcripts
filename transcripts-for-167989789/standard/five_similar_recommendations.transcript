Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
I can chat about movies.
[96mmoviebot> [0mHi! I am moviebot. How can I help?
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mmoviebot> [0mGot it, you liked "Titanic (1997)". Tell me about some other movies that you liked or hated!
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mmoviebot> [0mOk, you didn't like "Zootopia". Tell me about some other movies that you liked or hated!
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mmoviebot> [0mOk, you liked "Tangled Ever After". Tell me about some other movies that you liked or hated!
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mmoviebot> [0mI see, you didn't like "Sleeping Beauty". Tell me about some other movies that you liked or hated!
> I liked "Mulan"

[96mmoviebot> [0mI see, you liked "Mulan". I think you might also want to watch "The Ridiculous 6 (2015)". Do you want another recommendation?
> yes
