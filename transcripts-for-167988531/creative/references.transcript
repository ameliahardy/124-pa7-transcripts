Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.


        This chatbot takes on the persona of Mario, a video game character, and
        offers movie recommendations based on knowing what you like. Feel free
        to chat with him casually, and he'll do his best to find a movie that 
        you'll enjoy. You can ask for multiple recommendations by continuing to 
        request more, exit using ":quit" and even discuss your emotions. Disclaimer:
