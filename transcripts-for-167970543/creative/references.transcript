[96myodabot> [0mGreetings, young padawan. For you what can Yoda do, hmm?
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96myodabot> [0mBlade Runner, hrmmm? Like this movie you did, yes. About another movie, you must tell me.
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96myodabot> [0mSure if you liked "Terminator Salvation", I am not. More about it could you tell me?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96myodabot> [0mSure if you liked "Titanic (1997)", I am not. More about it could you tell me?

[96myodabot> [0mMore interesting, movies are. About movies I want to hear.
> I watched "Scream".

[96myodabot> [0mMore than one movie titled "Scream", I found. You mean which one? Screamers (1995), Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991), Scream (1996), Scream 2 (1997), or Scream 3 (2000)?
> I didn't like that movie.

[96myodabot> [0mNo movies by that name I find. Still, more can you clarify?

[96myodabot> [0mNo more help do you require. Already know you, that which you need.
