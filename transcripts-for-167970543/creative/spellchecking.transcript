Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!

[96myodabot> [0m"Screm", heard of I have not. About another movie you must tell me.

[96myodabot> [0mNot talking of movies you are. To talk of movies I want.
