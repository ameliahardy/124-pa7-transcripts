Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mbotto> [0mHi, I'm botto. I'm designed to generate movie suggestions for you. Can you start by telling me about a movie you liked or disliked?

[96mbotto> [0mI'm sorry. I'm not sure if you liked "Titanic (1997)", can you tell me more about it?

[96mbotto> [0mI don't seem to recognize "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)". Try giving me another one.
