Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        YodaBot can respond to regular speech, analyze a users sentiment of movies, 
        and give a recomendation of a new movie that the user may like given their 
        original preferences. When a user enters information about a movie, the movie
        should be enclosed in quotes and the users opinion on the movie should be
        provided. After providing five movie sentiments, YodaBot will return its movie
        recomendation.
