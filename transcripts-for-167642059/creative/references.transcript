Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        YodaBot can respond to regular speech, analyze a users sentiment of movies, 
        and give a recomendation of a new movie that the user may like given their 
        original preferences. When a user enters information about a movie, the movie
        should be enclosed in quotes and the users opinion on the movie should be
        provided. After providing five movie sentiments, YodaBot will return its movie
        recomendation. 
        
[96mYodaBot> [0mHi there, Yoda I am! Movies I recommend based on your movie preferences. Me about a movie you like or dislike, start by telling.
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mYodaBot> [0mGreat, so you liked Blade Runner (1982). What other movies have you seen and did you like or dislike them?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mYodaBot> [0mI'm sorry, I'm not sure if you liked Terminator Salvation (2009). Tell me more about it.
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mYodaBot> [0mIt seems like you were neutral with the movie Titanic (1997). If this is incorrect, tell me more about it.
> I liked it.

[96mYodaBot> [0mInteresting, that is.  Movie titles, put quotation marks around them, understand that I do. A movie recommender I am, remember that you must.
> I watched "Scream".

[96mYodaBot> [0mMore than one movie called "Scream", I found.  Hrmmm. Clarify which one using a key word or year, can you?: "Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991)", "Scream 3 (2000)", "Scream 2 (1997)", "Scream (1996)"
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mYodaBot> [0mWrong spelling possibly. Did you mean "Scream (1996)"? If so, type yes or no.
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mYodaBot> [0mIt seems like you were neutral with the movie Scream (1996). If this is incorrect, tell me more about it.
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mYodaBot> [0mIt seems like you were neutral with the movie Scream (1996). If this is incorrect, tell me more about it.
> :quit
[96mYodaBot> [0mFor using YodaBot, thank you. A lot of fun I had. Come back if you need more movie recommendations!
