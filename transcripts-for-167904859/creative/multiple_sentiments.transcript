Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Hello! This chatbot is for recommending movies to you based on the movies you have liked or disliked in the past. In starter mode, be sure to give your movie name in quotation marks. In creative mode, I'll be Dora the Explorer! I'll be keeping track of how strongly you feel about certain movies and we'll be able to interact in case you make any typos, or want to clarify a movie you mentioned. After I've heard about five of your movie tastes, I'll give you movie recommendations one after the other! Let's get started on our movie adventure!
