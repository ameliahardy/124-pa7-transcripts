Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Hello! This chatbot is for recommending movies to you based on the movies you have liked or disliked in the past. In starter mode, be sure to give your movie name in quotation marks. In creative mode, I'll be Dora the Explorer! I'll be keeping track of how strongly you feel about certain movies and we'll be able to interact in case you make any typos, or want to clarify a movie you mentioned. After I've heard about five of your movie tastes, I'll give you movie recommendations one after the other! Let's get started on our movie adventure!
[96mNikaphtina> [0mHi nice to talk to you!
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mNikaphtina> [0mOk, you liked Titanic (1997)! Tell me what you thought of another movie.
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mNikaphtina> [0mSorry to hear you weren't a fan of Zootopia. Any other movies you have opinions on?
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mNikaphtina> [0mIt's great that Tangled Ever After went well with you. Why don't you also talk about a different movie?
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mNikaphtina> [0mI'm sad that Sleeping Beauty wasn't really in your aisle. Could you share another movie opinion?
> I liked "Mulan"
