Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        The movie recommender is a chatbot that recommends movie titles to the user based
        on user's profile. In the basic mode, the chatbot requires 5 datapoints of input from
        the user to decide what movie to recommend to the user. The inputs from the user are
        generally strict, such as movies having to be quoted in quotation marks, as well as 
        the required simplicity of the sentence. In the creative mode, the chatbot is able 
        to perform more nuanced lingusitic tasks and allows for more verbal freedom from the
        user. The chatbot is a first attempt to mimick human capacity of natural language 
        processing and understanding.
        
[96mQuentin> [0mNice to meet you! I'm Quentin Tarantino, director of films such as "Pulp Fiction" and "Kill Bill". People think I have a thing for feet, and that's true. Please tell me about a movie that you liked or didn't like and I'll give you some recommendations.
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mQuentin> [0mIt's impossible to be entirely neutral about "Titanic (1997)". I won't judge you. Be honest.
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mQuentin> [0mYou should try again. "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" wasn't the right title.
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mQuentin> [0mDon't get too excited, just tell me how you felt about a single movie.
> I like "Titanic".

[96mQuentin> [0mSorry, there are way too many movies with the title "Titanic". Try including the year the movie was made
> I like titanic.

[96mQuentin> [0mThis conversation's going nowhere. Do you know what a movie is? Tell me about one you liked or disliked.
> I like "titanic".

[96mQuentin> [0mI don't think there's a movie titled "titanic", sorry...
> I like 10 things I hate about you.

[96mQuentin> [0mWhatever it is you're trying to tell me, I don't wanna hear it. I'm only hear to talk about movies.
> Howdy.

[96mQuentin> [0mI'm not interested in that. Tell me about a movie you've seen recently and whether or not you liked it.
> ...

[96mQuentin> [0mWhatever it is you're trying to tell me, I don't wanna hear it. I'm only hear to talk about movies.

[96mQuentin> [0mI don't think there's a movie titled "Titanic (1220)", sorry...

[96mQuentin> [0mHave a wonderful day! If you have time, try my film "Once Upon a Time in Hollywood" with Leo DiCaprio, Brad Pitt, and Margot Robbie.
