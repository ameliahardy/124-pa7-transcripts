Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        The movie recommender is a chatbot that recommends movie titles to the user based
        on user's profile. In the basic mode, the chatbot requires 5 datapoints of input from
        the user to decide what movie to recommend to the user. The inputs from the user are
        generally strict, such as movies having to be quoted in quotation marks, as well as 
        the required simplicity of the sentence. In the creative mode, the chatbot is able 
        to perform more nuanced lingusitic tasks and allows for more verbal freedom from the
        user. The chatbot is a first attempt to mimick human capacity of natural language 
        processing and understanding.
        
[96mQuentin> [0mNice to meet you! I'm Quentin Tarantino, director of films such as "Pulp Fiction" and "Kill Bill". People think I have a thing for feet, and that's true. Please tell me about a movie that you liked or didn't like and I'll give you some recommendations.
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mQuentin> [0mOooof, I won't judge you for liking "Blade Runner". Maybe a little. Give me another movie, be sure to tell me how you feel about it.
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mQuentin> [0mThat's a pretty neutral feeling towards "Terminator Salvation". Be honest, how do you REALLY feel about that movie?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mQuentin> [0mIt's impossible to be entirely neutral about "Titanic (1997)". I won't judge you. Be honest.
> I liked it.
