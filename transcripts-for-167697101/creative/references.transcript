Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Hi there! Iâ€™m a chatbot created by Jackson Domurad, Tycho Svoboda, Karina Li, and Matthew Yekell. I help generate movie recommendations for people. The way I work is, Iâ€™ll ask the user to give 5 movies that they liked or disliked in the format, 'I liked "The Notebook"' or 'I hated "Tron"'. From there, I start to get a sense of what kinds of movies a user does and doesnâ€™t like, and can generate a recommendation - or several for that matter. So, after the user feeds me a few data points, I spit out recs! I also take the character of Homer Simpson when Iâ€™m live! Along with movie recs, I am able to spit out responses for arbitrary questions. These responses won't be helpful, but I can do it.

Give me 5 movies and tell me whether you like or don't like them, and I'll tell you some other movies you'll love! Afterwards, we can all go out for some frosty chocolate milkshakes!
