Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Hi there! Iâ€™m a chatbot created by Jackson Domurad, Tycho Svoboda, Karina Li, and Matthew Yekell. I help generate movie recommendations for people. The way I work is, Iâ€™ll ask the user to give 5 movies that they liked or disliked in the format, 'I liked "The Notebook"' or 'I hated "Tron"'. From there, I start to get a sense of what kinds of movies a user does and doesnâ€™t like, and can generate a recommendation - or several for that matter. So, after the user feeds me a few data points, I spit out recs! I also take the character of Homer Simpson when Iâ€™m live! Along with movie recs, I am able to spit out responses for arbitrary questions. These responses won't be helpful, but I can do it.
