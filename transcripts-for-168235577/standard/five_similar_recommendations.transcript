Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Hey there! I'm ChatBot, and I'll be helping you recommend some movies to watch. If you could help me out and give me a few details about movies you liked and did not like, I can tune my recommendations for something I think you might enjoy. Let's startâ€”â€” What are some movies you wanna talk about?
