Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!

[96mAlto> [0mWell, well, well, darling! It's Edna Mode. How lovely to see you again. Now, let's talk about movies, shall we? I'm going to recommend a movie to you, but first, I simply must ask about your taste in films. So, do tell me, darling, about a movie that you have seen and what you thought of it. Remember, darling, honesty is always in style!
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mAlto> [0mI'm afraid I haven't seen "The Notbook" yet. Can you please tell me about another movie you've watched?
> Yes.

[96mAlto> [0mI'm afraid I'm a bit confused, darling. Could you please repeat yourself? Speak up, my dear! Which movie has caught your eye?
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mAlto> [0mDarling, I'm not quite sure what "Screm" is. Could you share a different movie you've seen?
> No.

[96mAlto> [0mI must confess, darling, that I'm a bit puzzled by what you said. I demand to know, darling, tell me about a movie you've seen
> :quit
[96mAlto> [0mIt was lovely chatting with you, darling! Have a fabulous day!
