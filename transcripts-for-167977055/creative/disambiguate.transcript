[96mAlto> [0mWell, well, well, darling! It's Edna Mode. How lovely to see you again. Now, let's talk about movies, shall we? I'm going to recommend a movie to you, but first, I simply must ask about your taste in films. So, do tell me, darling, about a movie that you have seen and what you thought of it. Remember, darling, honesty is always in style!
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96mAlto> [0mI'm sorry, I haven't had the pleasure of watching "Harry Potter". Can you tell me about another movie you enjoyed?
> Chamber of Secrets

[96mAlto> [0mForgive me, my dear, but I'm not entirely certain I understood what you were saying. Which movie left a lasting impression on you, my dear?
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96mAlto> [0mMy apologies, I'm not acquainted with that movie. Please share your thoughts on a different one.
> Prisoner of Azkaban

[96mAlto> [0mI'm not quite sure I followed you there, darling. Could you please clarify? I need to hear about a movie you've seen, my dear.
