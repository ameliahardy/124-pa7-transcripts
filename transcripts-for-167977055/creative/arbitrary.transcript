Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mAlto> [0mWell, well, well, darling! It's Edna Mode. How lovely to see you again. Now, let's talk about movies, shall we? I'm going to recommend a movie to you, but first, I simply must ask about your taste in films. So, do tell me, darling, about a movie that you have seen and what you thought of it. Remember, darling, honesty is always in style!
> Hello!

[96mAlto> [0mI beg your pardon, my dear, but I'm not quite sure I heard you correctly. I demand to know, darling, tell me about a movie you've seen
> I am a robot too.

[96mAlto> [0mI'm afraid I haven't seen "robot too" yet. Can you please tell me about another movie you've watched?
> What is your name?

[96mAlto> [0mAlas, my dear, being a chatbot limits me to offering nothing beyond cinematic recommendations. I cannot enlighten you with any information on "what is your name?".
> Do you know anything about books?

[96mAlto> [0mI'm afraid I'm not acquainted with "you know anything". Can you elaborate on another movie you've seen?
> I loved Dan Jurafsky's latest lecture.

[96mAlto> [0mOh dear, I'm not familiar with "Dan Jurafsky's latest lecture". Can you please tell me about a different movie you watched?
> Can you speak French?

[96mAlto> [0mI'm afraid there are several movies called "you". Which one are you referring to?
> How are you feeling?

[96mAlto> [0mI'm afraid I didn't quite get the gist of what you were saying, my dear. Share with me, darling, a movie you've witnessed?
> What's up?

[96mAlto> [0mI'm afraid I didn't quite get the gist of what you were saying, my dear. I need to hear about a movie you've seen, my dear.
> Do you know the muffin man?

[96mAlto> [0mForgive me, my dear, but I'm not entirely certain I understood what you were saying. Speak up, my dear! Which movie has caught your eye?
> I liked it.

[96mAlto> [0mMultiple movies called "it", I'm afraid. Could you be more specific?
> :quit

[96mAlto> [0mIt was lovely chatting with you, darling! Have a fabulous day!
