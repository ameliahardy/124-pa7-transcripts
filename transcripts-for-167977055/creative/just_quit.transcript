Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mAlto> [0mWell, well, well, darling! It's Edna Mode. How lovely to see you again. Now, let's talk about movies, shall we? I'm going to recommend a movie to you, but first, I simply must ask about your taste in films. So, do tell me, darling, about a movie that you have seen and what you thought of it. Remember, darling, honesty is always in style!
