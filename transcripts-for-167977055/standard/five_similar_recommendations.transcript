Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mAlto> [0mHi! I'm Alto I'm going to recommend a movie to you. First I will ask you about your taste in movies. Tell me about a movie that you have seen.
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mAlto> [0mGlad you enjoyed "Titanic (1997)". Could you talk about a movie that you have seen?
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mAlto> [0mOk, you didn't like watching "Zootopia (2016)". Can you describe a movie that you recently watched?
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mAlto> [0mSounds like you thought "Tangled Ever After (2012)" was a great movie. Thank you! Can you describe a movie that you recently watched?
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mAlto> [0mYou did not liked "Sleeping Beauty (1959)". Thank you! Have you seen any movies lately? Tell me about one.
> I liked "Mulan"

[96mAlto> [0mGlad you enjoyed "Mulan (1998)".Your input has given me enough information to suggest a movie. "The Ridiculous 6 (2015)" is a solid new movie choice. Do you want to hear another suggestion?(Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> yes

[96mAlto> [0mI think you'd like "Pixels (2015)". Would you like to hear another recommendation?(Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> yes

[96mAlto> [0mYou might want to check out "World War Z (2013)". Would you like to hear another recommendation?(Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> yes
