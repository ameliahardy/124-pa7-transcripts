Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

Anthropomorphizing chatbot systems may make it impossible for certain users who don't have enough background (for example,
children or people who don't know about artificial intelligence) to realize that it is not a human who is talking to them.
Thus, they may share private information to the robot or give a too high level of trust in the robot's responses.

To ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human, engineers could stop giving human
names to bots and clearly write a warning message saying that it is a bot and not a human behind the screen. For example,
the first message of a conversation with the robot could be a question asking the user to acknowledge that he understands
it is a bot and not human that is writing. Furthermore, the bot should be trained at detecting when the user shares too
much private information so that a human agent can continue the conversation.

Note on fine-grained sentiment extration: There was no definition of what "super negative" or "super positive" was
(e.g. certain words that exude more senitment than others?) so the code makes the assumption that "super" is equivalent to 
the presence of only one sentiment in the sentence (either positive or negative).
