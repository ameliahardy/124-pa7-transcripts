TODO: Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

Answer: Some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems include students using chatbots to do
school work, growing reliance on technology, scammers using chatbots to write pieces that sound legitimate, poor,
illogical, or dangerous advice to users, and biased opinions or answers. However, there are several ways engineers 
can ensure that users can easily distinguish chatbot responses from those of a human. For instance, engineers 
can build other AI systems that detect differences between chatbot and human responses. Whereas "good" writing by
humans often consider diverse vocabulary and syntax, chatbot responses may include greater repetition of certain 
words, phrases, or syntax. Chatbot responses may also lack creativity and sentiment to a certain degree— while a 
chatbot may use idioms, adjectives, and imagery, the phrases they use may be overused, general, or repetitive. 
Lastly, for longer essays or writing on a specific topic, chatbots tend to write redundantly with little to no 
depth or analysis but greater emphasis on summary or simple thematic ideas.
