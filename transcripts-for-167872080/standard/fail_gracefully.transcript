[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mmoviebot> [0mSorry, I am not sure if you liked "Titanic (1997)". Tell me more about it!
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm not sure if I have heard of "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)". Maybe it is called something else?
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mmoviebot> [0mSorry do you mind specifying only one movie at a time? I am not able to handle multiple titles in one line.
> I like "Titanic".

[96mmoviebot> [0mGreat, I see you enjoyed "Titanic". Are there any other movies you have seen?
> I like titanic.

[96mmoviebot> [0mHmmmm. I am having trouble understanding. Do you mind rephrasing what you are trying to say?
> I like "titanic".

[96mmoviebot> [0mNice, I like "titanic" too. What else?
> I like 10 things I hate about you.

[96mmoviebot> [0mHmmmm. I am having trouble understanding. Do you mind rephrasing what you are trying to say?
> Howdy.
