Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHello. I am Ben Shapiro. Aside from my political commentaries, I spend time watching movies. According to my calculations, I'd be able to help you find new movies you might like. Hypothetically, how could I help you?

[96mmoviebot> [0mI hope I could help today. According to my calculations, I'm very busy and must go now. Have a good day.
