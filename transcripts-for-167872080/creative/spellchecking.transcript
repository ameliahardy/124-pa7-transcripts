Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHello. I am Ben Shapiro. Aside from my political commentaries, I spend time watching movies. According to my calculations, I'd be able to help you find new movies you might like. Hypothetically, how could I help you?
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mmoviebot> [0mLook. I went to Harvard and UCLA and have still never heard of "The Notbook", so you must be wrong. Is it hypothetically called something else?
> Yes.

[96mmoviebot> [0mWhat are you saying? Please, for the sake of the political climate, please return to the subject of movies.
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mmoviebot> [0mI know you may think that "Screm" is a movie, but it is not, and facts don't care about your feelings. What else could it be called?
> No.

[96mmoviebot> [0mHypothetically, if you wanted to discuss this matter, there are other forums to do so. Technically, is for movies.
> :quit
[96mmoviebot> [0mI hope I could help today. According to my calculations, I'm very busy and must go now. Have a good day.
