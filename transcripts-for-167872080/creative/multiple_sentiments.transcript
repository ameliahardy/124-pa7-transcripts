[96mmoviebot> [0mHello. I am Ben Shapiro. Aside from my political commentaries, I spend time watching movies. According to my calculations, I'd be able to help you find new movies you might like. Hypothetically, how could I help you?
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mmoviebot> [0mSorry do you mind specifying only one movie at a time? I am not able to handle multiple titles in one line.
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".
