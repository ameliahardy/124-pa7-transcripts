TODO: Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

Dangers of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems is that users could take the advice of the chatbot as if it was a sentient 
human beings. Because training data comes from open-sourced places like reddit, chatbots are trained on dangerous phrases and 
statements. When the reproduce this, if a person believes the chatbot to be human, they are more likely to trust what it saying. 
A way to prevent this is would be to alter the way it rights to be more robotic. This could make it seem less human. This could be 
implemented by removing slang from the dictionary of the chatbot. Additionally the chatbot could not use pronouns and could be 
given non-human names.
