Thomas Yim - I did identifying movies in quotation marks with correct capitalization, standard finding movies, disambiguation (part 1 and 2),
sentiment extraction (for single and multiple), binarize, and the dialogue for multiple movie sentiment

Claire Shao - I worked on coding the recommend function, the starter mode process function, generationg naturalistic and varied responses,
and dialogue handling with disambiguation (storing memory of previous movie mentions and reprompting if an incorrect resposne was given).

Rachel Park - I implemented some creative features, including identifying movies without quotation marks and correct capitalization, 
identifying and responding to emotions, etc.

Emily Deng - I did the ethics question and implemented some creative features, including alternate/foreign titles, spell-correcting, 
and chatbot persona.

TODO: Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

As chatbots become more and more human-like, people may start to confide in the machine in regards to personal information
and problems. We saw this even with ELIZA when some researchers were hesitant to store and analyze the conversations, suggesting that
they had been telling ELIZA sensitive content (Chatbot Lecture page 41). The danger with this is that information on the internet always has some security
uncertainties (especially when people are generally lazy about reading "Terms and Conditions" pages). Extended conversations with chatbots that involve 
private content could lead to serious data leaks and privacy breaches (e.g. I tell the chatbot about my health problems, and the chatbot company takes this information
to build a lucrative profile about me).

Another possible ramification is that chatbots may not have the same emotional and cognitive capacities as humans. When Weizenbaum's staff
asked him to step out of the room during conversations with ELIZA, it was likely because they had developed some sort of emotional
connection with the program (Chatbot lecture page 41). However, it is important to remember that these programs do not necessarily
have the same moral and ethical considerations as humans, so seeking their advice or opinion in important matters is not be wise.

One possible way to distinguish chatbot responses from those of a human is to constantly remind the user of the chatbot's machine status; 
for example, Character.ai, a chatbot impersonating different characters, has a disclaimer about chatbots when a new user enters the website. 
Another possibility to help users easily distinguish chatbots is to make their responses intentionally very robotic. The chatbot
could stick to simple, factual sentences and avoid tackling problems of moral or ethical implications by saying something like, 
"that is beyond the scope of my expertise."
