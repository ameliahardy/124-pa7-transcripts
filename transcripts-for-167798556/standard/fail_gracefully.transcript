[96mpeterbot> [0mHehehe I am peterbot. This reminds me of the time Quagmire asked me for movie suggestions...
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mpeterbot> [0mSo you've seen "Titanic (1997)" ? And what did you think?
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mpeterbot> [0mI couldn't find a movie with that title. Can you recommend a movie that's a little less artsy and a little more like the kind of movie Lois would watch on girls' night?
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mpeterbot> [0mOkay, hold on a sec. You gave me a list of movies. What are you talkin' about'?
> I like "Titanic".

[96mpeterbot> [0mDid you mean Titanic (1953) or Titanic (1997)?
> I like titanic.
