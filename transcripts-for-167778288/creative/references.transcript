Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you?
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mmoviebot> [0mGood to hear you enjoyed watching "Blade Runner". Tell me about another movie you've seen.
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mmoviebot> [0mSorry, I'm not sure if you liked "Terminator Salvation". Please share more about it!
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI can't seem to figure out your thoughts on "Titanic (1997)". If you give me more details, I may be able to learn more about your opinion!
> I liked it.

[96mmoviebot> [0mSorry, I'm not sure what movie(s) you're talking about. Please try again by adding quotation marks around the titles!
> I watched "Scream".

[96mmoviebot> [0mIt looks like there are multiple movies with that name. Please clarify which movie you are discussing out of the following: 
"Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991)"
"Scream (1996)"
"Scream 2 (1997)"
"Scream 3 (2000)"
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mmoviebot> [0mSorry, I'm not sure what movie(s) you're talking about. Please try again by adding quotation marks around the titles!
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mmoviebot> [0mSorry, I'm not sure if you liked "Zootopia". I'd loved to hear more to better understand your thoughts!
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mmoviebot> [0mGiven what you told me, I think you would like Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Would you like more recommendations? (Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> :quit
[96mmoviebot> [0mHave a nice day!
