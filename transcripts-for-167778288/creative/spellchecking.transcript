Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you?
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI can't say I've heard of "The Notbook". Did you mean to talk about "Notebook, The (2004)"?
> Yes.

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm glad you liked "Notebook, The (2004)". Tell me about another movie you've seen.
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mmoviebot> [0mI can't say I've heard of "Screm". Did you mean to talk about "Scream (1996)"?

[96mmoviebot> [0mOk! You can enter :quit if you're done.
> :quit
[96mmoviebot> [0mHave a nice day!
