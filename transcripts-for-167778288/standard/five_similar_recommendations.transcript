Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you?
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mmoviebot> [0mGood to hear you enjoyed watching "Titanic (1997)". Please share your thoughts on a different film!
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mmoviebot> [0mWow, that bad, huh. I'm sorry you didn't enjoy "Zootopia". Let me know your thoughts on another movie.
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm glad you liked "Tangled Ever After". Let me know your thoughts on another movie.
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mmoviebot> [0mWow, that bad, huh. I'm sorry you didn't enjoy "Sleeping Beauty". Please share your thoughts on a different film!
> I liked "Mulan"

[96mmoviebot> [0mGiven what you told me, I think you would like "The Ridiculous 6 (2015)". Would you like another recommendation? (Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> yes

[96mmoviebot> [0mFor sure, another good choice would be "World War Z (2013)". How about another one?(Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> yes
