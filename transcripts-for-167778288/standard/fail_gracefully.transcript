Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm having trouble telling how you felt about the movie "Titanic (1997)". Please share more about it!
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mmoviebot> [0mSorry I haven't heard of "Dan Jurafsky And The Ten Dwarfs (2019)" before. Please share your thoughts on a different film!
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'd love to talk about "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You" individually! I'm a simple chatbot and can only handle one movie at a time.
> I like "Titanic".

[96mmoviebot> [0mIt looks like there's more than one movie called ""Titanic"". You clarify by including the year as (full year) after the title or using an alternate title!
> I like titanic.

[96mmoviebot> [0mSorry, I'm not sure what movie you're talking about. Please try again by adding quotation marks around the title of the movie!
> I like "titanic".
