Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHi! I'm MovieBot! I'm going to recommend a movie to you. First I will ask you about your taste in movies. Tell me about a movie that you have seen.
> I liked "Blade Runner".

Got it, you liked 'Blade Runner'
[96mmoviebot> [0mWhat's another movie you liked/disliked?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

Got it, you didn't like 'Terminator Salvation'
[96mmoviebot> [0mWhat's another movie you liked/disliked?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

Got it, you didn't like 'Titanic (1997)'
[96mmoviebot> [0mWhat's another movie you liked/disliked?
> I liked it.

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm not sure I understand.
> I watched "Scream".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI found more than one movie called 'Scream'. Which one did you mean? ['Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991)', 'Scream 3 (2000)', 'Scream 2 (1997)', 'Scream (1996)']

> I didn't like that movie.

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm still not sure which movie you're talking about. Try being more specific!

> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

Got it, you didn't like 'Zootopia'
[96mmoviebot> [0mWhat's another movie you liked/disliked?
> And also "Ex Machina".

Got it, you didn't like 'Ex Machina'
That's all the info I needed! Let me think about what kind of movies you'd like...
