Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHi! I'm MovieBot! I'm going to recommend a movie to you. First I will ask you about your taste in movies. Tell me about a movie that you have seen.
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

Got it, you didn't like 'Titanic (1997)', and you didn't like 'Ex Machina'
[96mmoviebot> [0mWhat's another movie you liked/disliked?
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

Got it, you liked 'Zootopia', and you didn't like 'Scream'
[96mmoviebot> [0mWhat's another movie you liked/disliked?
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

Got it, you didn't like 'Zootopia', and you didn't like 'Eat Pray Love'
That's all the info I needed! Let me think about what kind of movies you'd like...
