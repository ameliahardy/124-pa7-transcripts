Jackson and Matthew collaborated on the majority of the starter code. Tycho and Karina contributed 
to the creative aspects of the Chatbot. Everyone met together to debug issues throughout
the entire project.

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

___Answer___

When it comes to implementing chatbot systems within customer service, these human-like qualities may exacerbate the emotions that the customer is feeling in that moment. For example, when dealing with angry customers, studies have found that chatbot anthromorphism had a negative effect on customer satisfaction and caused customers to hold an overall negative view of the company. 

One way to ensure that users can easily distinguish between the chatbot responses by providing disclaimers to the user and reestablishing that the chatbot responses are coming from an algorithm that has is not backed up by real humans. By increasing tranparency and educating chatbot users, engineers can help mitigate any issues that come with chatbot anthromorphism.
