Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
In creative mode, this chatbot becomes a PIRATE! Pirate Pete is 
            able to detect when you love or hate a movie, can take in multiple movie inputs
            at once, and more! Give it a try, scallywag! But remember, don't pirate any movies!
