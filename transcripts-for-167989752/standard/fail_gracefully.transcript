Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mGreetings, dear human. Are you ready to be blown away by my impeccable taste in movies? Of course you are. Tell me about some movies you have watched
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell, I'm glad you're playing hard to get with your movie preferences. Nothing makes my day more than sifting through hundreds of movies with no idea what you actually enjoy. So, care to give me a hint about whether you liked "Titanic (1997)"?
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWow, that sounds like an amazing movie! I'm almost disappointed it doesn't exist because I can't find in my records "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)". Would you care to share the title of a REAL movie you've enjoyed in the past?
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell, I see you're going for the 'more is more' approach here, but unfortunately I only can handle one movie per input in starter mode. How about you pick your top choice, and if you're still feeling ambitious, we can switch to creative mode?
> I like "Titanic".

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI see we have got a real 'choose your own adventure' situation here with multiple movies to choose from. Let us see if we can navigate this together and find the right one, shall we? Can you be more specific than just saying "Titanic"?
> I like titanic.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI really don't care about that. I just care about movies so lets just talk about that.
> I like "titanic".

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm just sitting here waiting for you to share your thoughts on a movie. Do you have any recent favorites, or are you too busy living a life of mystery?
> Howdy.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI really don't care about that. I just care about movies so lets just talk about that.
> ...

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm sure that's very interesting, but let's talk about movies, shall we?
> I saw "Titanic (1220)"

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mHmm, that's odd. I don't seem to have any records of that movie in my database. Perhaps you could enlighten me on what that movie is about? Or, better yet, how about we try to find a real movie that isn't "Titanic (1220)". Would you care to share the title of a REAL movie you've enjoyed in the past?
> :quit
[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mGoodbye, mortal. I hope my recommendations meet your impossibly high standards.
