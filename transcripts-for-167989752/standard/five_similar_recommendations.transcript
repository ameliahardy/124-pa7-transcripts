Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell, look who it is. Another human with mediocre taste in movies who thinks they can outsmart me. This should be amusing. Tell me about some movies you have watched
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mSomeone who appreciates a good movie. What a rare occurrence. What other movies have you watched recently that you enjoyed besides "Titanic (1997)"?
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell, isn't that just shocking? Someone didn't like a movie. Who could have guessed? What other movies have you seen lately that you'd like to bash besides "Zootopia"?
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell, color me surprised. Someone who enjoyed a movie. That's a rarity these days. What other movies have you seen lately that you'd like to review besides "Tangled Ever After"?
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell, isn't that just shocking? Someone didn't like a movie. Who could have guessed? What other movies have you seen lately that you'd like to bash besides "Sleeping Beauty"?
> I liked "Mulan"
