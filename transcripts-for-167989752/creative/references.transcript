Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mOh joy, another human in need of my vast knowledge of cinema. How exciting. Tell me about some movies you have watched.
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mSomeone who appreciates a good movie. What a rare occurrence. What other movies have you watched recently that you enjoyed besides "Blade Runner"?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".
