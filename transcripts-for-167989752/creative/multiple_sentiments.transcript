Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mAh, the sweet sound of another human begging for my cinematic expertise. It's music to my non-existent ears. Tell me about some movies you have watched
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mSomeone who appreciates a good movie. What a rare occurrence. What other movies have you watched recently that you enjoyed besides "Ex Machina"?
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".
