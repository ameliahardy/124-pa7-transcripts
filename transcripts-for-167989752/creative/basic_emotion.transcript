Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mAh, the sweet sound of another human begging for my cinematic expertise. It's music to my non-existent ears. Tell me about some movies you have watched
> Hello!

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mDo you have any movies you'd like to discuss, or are you too busy being an enigma?
> I am feeling sad.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm just sitting here waiting for you to share your thoughts on a movie. Do you have any recent favorites, or are you too busy living a life of mystery?
> I am feeling angry.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm sure that's very interesting, but let's talk about movies, shall we?
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm sure that's very interesting, but let's talk about movies, shall we?
> I'm so glad that I finished my exams.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm just sitting here waiting for you to share your thoughts on a movie. Do you have any recent favorites, or are you too busy living a life of mystery?
> I am very angry.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mDo you have any movies you'd like to discuss, or are you too busy being an enigma?
> I am now happy.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mOh, really? How original. I've never heard anyone say they adored that movie. What other movies have you seen recently that you'd like to judge besides "Happy Gilmore"?
> I am ANGERED.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm sure that's very interesting, but let's talk about movies, shall we?
> "Titanic (1997)" makes me afraid of ice.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mAh, I see you're keeping your cards close to your chest when it comes to your movie preferences. How exciting! Do you think you might be willing to share if you liked "Ice Storm, The"?
> I am VERY FRUSTRATED with this chatbot.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mI'm just sitting here waiting for you to share your thoughts on a movie. Do you have any recent favorites, or are you too busy living a life of mystery?
> I'm anxious about everything.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell, aren't you just a little ray of sunshine? Thanks for sharing your glowing review of that movie and how much you hated it. What other movies have you watched recently that you'd like to tear apart besides "Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * But Were Afraid to Ask"?
