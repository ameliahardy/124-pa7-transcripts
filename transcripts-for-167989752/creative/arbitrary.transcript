Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mOh joy, another human in need of my vast knowledge of cinema. How exciting. Tell me about some movies you have watched.
> Hello!

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mThat's great, but let's bring it back to movies for a moment. Tell me about some movies you have watched.
> I am a robot too.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWow, congratulations on your expert opinion. I'm sure the filmmakers are devastated to hear that you didn't like their movie. What other movies have you watched recently that you'd like to criticize besides "Marrying Man, The (Too Hot to Handle)"?
> What is your name?

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mAh, I see you're keeping your cards close to your chest when it comes to your movie preferences. How exciting! Do you think you might be willing to share if you liked "Name of the Rose, The (Name der Rose, Der)"?
> Do you know anything about books?

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mThat's great, but let's bring it back to movies for a moment. Tell me about some movies you have watched.
> I loved Dan Jurafsky's latest lecture.

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mDo you have any movies you'd like to discuss, or are you too busy being an enigma?
> Can you speak French?

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mWell...did you like "French Twist (Gazon maudit)"?
> How are you feeling?

[96mSarcasticMovieBot> [0mSoo you didn't even say if you liked it or not. Did you like "Feeling Minnesota"?
> What's up?
