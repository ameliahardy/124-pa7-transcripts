Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        This chatbot has two modes, standard and creative. It will ask you for 5 movie,
        and if you are in creative mode, you can specify many of those movies together!
        Once you tell chatbot how you feel about those movies, it will start recommending them.
        I hope you enjoy using it and get some great movie recommendations!
        
[96mCERTain bot> [0mHowdy! They call me CERTain bot. I created by Claire, Emily, Rachel, and Thomas. Tell me about a movie you do or don't like!
> Hello!

[96mCERTain bot> [0mY'all about as useful as tits on a bull. Tell me a movie y'all have watched!! Tell me about another movie you've watched. Did it tickle your toes or scratch your back?
> I am feeling sad.

[96mCERTain bot> [0mWhy y'all so sad darlin'? My heart ain't too blessed to hear that. 
> I am feeling angry.

[96mCERTain bot> [0mYou're angry! Well, I'll be damned, now I'm angry. 
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mCERTain bot> [0mI'm madder than a wet hen, you didn't give me a movie! We'll be waiting till the cows come home if y'all keep taking this long. Any other favorite or least favorite movies?
> I'm so glad that I finished my exams.

[96mCERTain bot> [0mY'all about as useful as tits on a bull. Tell me a movie y'all have watched!! I'm fixin to a recommendation for y'all. Can y'all give me another movie y'all liked or disliked?
> I am very angry.

[96mCERTain bot> [0mYou're angry! Well, I'll be damned, now I'm angry. 
> I am now happy.

[96mCERTain bot> [0mGrinnin' like a possum eatin' a sweet tater because you're happy! That's what I am. 
> I am ANGERED.

[96mCERTain bot> [0mY'all about as useful as tits on a bull. Tell me a movie y'all have watched!! Betcha can't name one more movie!
> "Titanic (1997)" makes me afraid of ice.

[96mCERTain bot> [0mY'all didn't like "Titanic (1997)"? I'll remember that like I remember the 1999 wheat harvest. Tell me about another movie you've watched. Did it tickle your toes or scratch your back?
> I am VERY FRUSTRATED with this chatbot.
