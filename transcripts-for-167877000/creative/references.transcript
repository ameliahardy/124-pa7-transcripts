Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        This chatbot has two modes, standard and creative. It will ask you for 5 movie,
        and if you are in creative mode, you can specify many of those movies together!
        Once you tell chatbot how you feel about those movies, it will start recommending them.
        I hope you enjoy using it and get some great movie recommendations!
