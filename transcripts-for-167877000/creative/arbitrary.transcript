Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        This chatbot has two modes, standard and creative. It will ask you for 5 movie,
        and if you are in creative mode, you can specify many of those movies together!
        Once you tell chatbot how you feel about those movies, it will start recommending them.
        I hope you enjoy using it and get some great movie recommendations!
        
[96mCERTain bot> [0mHowdy! They call me CERTain bot. I created by Claire, Emily, Rachel, and Thomas. Tell me about a movie you do or don't like!
> Hello!

[96mCERTain bot> [0mI'm madder than a wet hen, you didn't give me a movie! We'll be waiting till the cows come home if y'all keep taking this long. Any other favorite or least favorite movies?
> I am a robot too.

[96mCERTain bot> [0mY'all about as useful as tits on a bull. Tell me a movie y'all have watched!! Darlin' you're dryer than the dining hall chicken. Gimme another movie!
> What is your name?

[96mCERTain bot> [0mSweetie darling pie, I don't see a movie in between quotes. Tell me about another movie you've watched. Did it tickle your toes or scratch your back?
> Do you know anything about books?

[96mCERTain bot> [0mNot telling me a movie doesn't even amount to a hill of beans! I'll give y'all another try 'cause I'm feeling nice. Gimme some sugar, any more movies you've loved or hated?
> I loved Dan Jurafsky's latest lecture.

[96mCERTain bot> [0mY'all about as useful as tits on a bull. Tell me a movie y'all have watched!! Almost there partner, can you tell me another movie though?
> Can you speak French?
