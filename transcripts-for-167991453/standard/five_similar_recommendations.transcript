Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mNetflixer> [0mHello, how can I help you today?
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mNetflixer> [0mSo, you loved Titanic (1997). What other movies did you have in mind?
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mNetflixer> [0mThat's unfortunate that you did not take a pleasing to Zootopia. What other movies did you have in mind?
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mNetflixer> [0mIt's awesome that you were entertained by Tangled Ever After. What other movies did you have in mind?
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mNetflixer> [0mI understand that you did not really enjoy Sleeping Beauty. What other movie have you had the pleasure of seeing?
> I liked "Mulan"
