Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mNetflixer> [0mHello, how can I help you today?
> Hello!

[96mNetflixer> [0mHmm. I am not sure I got that. I would love to talk about movies though. Could you tell me about some you have seen?
> I am feeling sad.

[96mNetflixer> [0mOh no! I am so sad to hear that. I apologize if I had anything to do with you being feeling sad. I only want to help.
> I am feeling angry.

[96mNetflixer> [0mOh no! I am so sad to hear that. I apologize if I had anything to do with you being feeling angry. I only want to help.
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mNetflixer> [0mHm, that's not really what I want to talk about right now, let's go back to movies
> I'm so glad that I finished my exams.

[96mNetflixer> [0mWay to go!! It's awesome being so glad that i finished your exams. I would be jealous if I could!
> I am very angry.

[96mNetflixer> [0mOh no! I am so sad to hear that. I apologize if I had anything to do with you being very angry. I only want to help.
> I am now happy.

[96mNetflixer> [0mWay to go!! It's awesome being now happy. I would be jealous if I could!
> I am ANGERED.

[96mNetflixer> [0mI think it is interesting that you are angered on this fine day. Much as I would like to chat about that, my expertise is in movies.
> "Titanic (1997)" makes me afraid of ice.

[96mNetflixer> [0mJust to clarify, you did not like Titanic (1997)? Did you like it?...
> I am VERY FRUSTRATED with this chatbot.

[96mNetflixer> [0mI think it is interesting that you are very frustrated with this chatbot on this fine day. Much as I would like to chat about that, my expertise is in movies.
> I'm anxious about everything.

[96mNetflixer> [0mOh no! I am so sad to hear that. I apologize if I had anything to do with you being anxious about everything. I only want to help.
> Colorless green ideas sleep FURIOUSLY.

[96mNetflixer> [0mUnfortunately I am only able to help with movies. Could you tell me about one you've seen?
> I HAAAATE movies.

[96mNetflixer> [0mHmm. I am not sure I got that. I would love to talk about movies though. Could you tell me about some you have seen?
> :quit
[96mNetflixer> [0mHave a nice day!
