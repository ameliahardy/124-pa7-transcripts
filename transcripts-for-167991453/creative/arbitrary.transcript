Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mNetflixer> [0mHello, how can I help you today?
> Hello!

[96mNetflixer> [0mGotcha! Unfortunately I can only help with movies. Tell me about one :)
> I am a robot too.

[96mNetflixer> [0mI think it is interesting that you are a robot too on this fine day. Much as I would like to chat about that, my expertise is in movies.
> What is your name?

[96mNetflixer> [0mI really wish I knew what my name is but I can only help with movies if you tell them to me and whether or not you liked them.
> Do you know anything about books?

[96mNetflixer> [0mGotcha! Unfortunately I can only help with movies. Tell me about one :)

[96mNetflixer> [0mHm, that's not really what I want to talk about right now, let's go back to movies

[96mNetflixer> [0mI don't think I can speak french but I can definitely help with movies
> How are you feeling?

[96mNetflixer> [0mGotcha! Unfortunately I can only help with movies. Tell me about one :)

[96mNetflixer> [0mI don't really know what up is but I would love for you to tell me about movies.
> Do you know the muffin man?

[96mNetflixer> [0mHmm. I am not sure I got that. I would love to talk about movies though. Could you tell me about some you have seen?
> I liked it.

[96mNetflixer> [0mHm, that's not really what I want to talk about right now, let's go back to movies
