[96mNetflixer> [0mHello, how can I help you today?
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mNetflixer> [0m Hmm. I'm sorry to hear that you hated Titanic (1997).  So it was not fun to watch Ex Machina. 
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mNetflixer> [0m Nice! You liked Zootopia.  I can see several movies with the title Scream. Could you please give me more information?
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mNetflixer> [0m That's unfortunate that you did not take a pleasing to Zootopia.  I understand that you did not really enjoy Eat Pray Love. 
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"
