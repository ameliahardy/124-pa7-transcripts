Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mNetflixer> [0mHello, how can I help you today?
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mNetflixer> [0mDamn it! I do not seem to have The Notbook in my database. My apologies, could you tell me about another one?
> Yes.

[96mNetflixer> [0mUnfortunately I am only able to help with movies. Could you tell me about one you've seen?
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mNetflixer> [0mI couldn't find the movie Screm. Could you check and try again? Or tell me about another movie?
> No.

[96mNetflixer> [0mGotcha! Unfortunately I can only help with movies. Tell me about one :)
> :quit
[96mNetflixer> [0mHave a nice day!
