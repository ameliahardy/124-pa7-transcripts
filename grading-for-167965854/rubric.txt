Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

Anthropomorphizing chatbot systems can have a number of negative effects, including 1) Unrealistic expectations, When users start to anthropomorphize chatbots, they could anticipate that the chatbot would have traits like empathy and consciousness that are currently impractical given the state of technology. People may put too much trust in chatbots, especially if they think they have talents that are comparable to those of a human. Users could act on inaccurate or damaging information provided by the chatbot as a result of this mistaken confidence. 3 ethical issues Users may be more inclined to treat chatbots like humans if they think they have human-like abilities. 
Using chatbots in these circumstances could create ethical questions about how they should be handled, especially if they  involve delicate or sensitive subjects. 
Engineers may want to think about ensuring users cam tell the difference between chatbots and humans. Engineers could make sure that the chatbot's responses are clearly identifiable as having been produced by a chatbot like with hidden water marks. They could also be achieved with a signature or disclaimer. Developers may restrict the chatbot's skills to those that are obviously artificial, like presenting true information or carrying out easy tasks. Error messages might be incorporated into the chatbot's design to assist reinforce the notion that it is a computer and not human.
