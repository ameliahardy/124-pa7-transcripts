Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA.
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice,
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks,
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

Anthropomorphizing chatbot systems can have severe consequences. For example, the user may believe the system has
its own emotions, feelings, and opinions, which may take the user to trust the machine when asking about personal matters.
For example, the user may consult the chatbot for relationship advice, which could be misleading, mainly if the database
contains offensive material that does not respect human rights.
We can take many measures to ensure that users can easily distinguish chatbot responses from those of a human. Firstly, we
can explicitly program the chatbot to identify itself as a machine in the conversation. We can also use distinctive language
or formatting in the chatbot's responses, such as brackets or parentheses, indicating that it is a machine-generated response.
Another approach is limiting the chatbot's range of responses to specific topics or contexts, making it less likely to produce
inappropriate or offensive responses. We can also include disclaimers or warnings before users interact with the chatbot to
clarify that they are not communicating with a human.
Overall, it is essential to be transparent about the capabilities and limitations of chatbot systems and to design them in a
way that is easily distinguishable from human responses.
