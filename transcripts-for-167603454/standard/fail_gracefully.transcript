Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Bot: Pycaprio (Starter Mode)
            
            Bot Spec:
                - Ability to identify movies in quotation marks with correct capitalization like "Her (2013)" or "Her"
                - Ability to extract simple sentiment and give recommendations after >= 5 user valid movie inputs
                - Ability to keep giving further recommendation and reset the system after having recommended 10 movies
                to avoid imprecise recommendation
                - Ability to speak in different ways (e.g. Tell me about a movie that you have seen. &  Can you tell me
                about a different movie you have watched?) using randomization
                - Ability to disambiguate movies of the same titles (no funnel widening) with different years while
                still keeping track of the sentiment.
                - Ability to perform disambiguation in multiple turns

                    Pycaprio> I found more than one movie called "Titanic". Which of these were you referring to when
                    you mentioned it: "Titanic (1953)" or "Titanic (1997)"?

            Bot Limitation
                - Lack of ability to identify movies by its foreign names
                - Lack of ability to handle arbitrary inputs of certain forms and emotion and loop back to the previous question
                it asks the user
                - Lack of ability to widen the funnel
                - Lack of ability to find movie closest to title and ask the user to confirm while still keeping track of the
                sentiment user expresses (as in disambiguation)
                - Lack of ability to communicate multiple sentiments given multiple-movie input (Our bot can commnicate
                if there is one sentiment for all movies though.)(We implement extract_sentiment_for_movies but did not
                use it in the core structure.)
