            Bot Spec:
                - Ability to identify movies in quotation marks with/without correct capitalization
                like "Her (2013)", "Her", or "her".
                - Ability to extract simple sentiment and give recommendations after >= 5 user valid movie inputs
                - Ability to keep giving further recommendation and reset the system after having recommended 10 movies
                to avoid imprecise recommendation
                - Ability to identify movies with foreign names like "Chaharshanbe-soori"
                - Ability to identify movies without quotation marks like one within "I thought 10 things i hate about
                you was great"
                - Ability to widen the funnel by returning all movies containing the tokens in title as a sublist
                - Ability to disambiguate movies given the clarification while still keeping track of the sentiment. Note
                that this ability is insenstive to the case of clarification. The clarification can either be year, some
                part of the title names like 'part 1', etc.

                    struck a chord with you. Might one be so kind as to elucidate another motion picture which one has

                    struck a chord with you. Thank you kindly, my friend. That shall suffice for me to make a recommendation.
                    In light of the facts at hand, I recommend that you view the film "After Earth (2013)". Care to
                    entertain another proposal? (Or type :quit if you're all done.)

            Bot Limitation
                - Lack of ability to extract multiple movie names in the utterance that contains a mix of titles with quotations
                and titles without quotations
                - Lack of ability to perform widening the funnel well when there is no quotation for movie title(s)
                - Lack of ability to communicate multiple sentiments given multiple-movie input (Our bot can commnicate
                if there is one sentiment for all movies though.)(We implement extract_sentiment_for_movies but did not
                use it in the core structure.)
                
            Recommended Usage
                - Use quotation to specify movies for best experience in using various kinds of features (The movie names
                does not need to be complete.)
                - Try typing without quotation to explore bot limitation further
                - When you are curious if some feature works, try putting quotations as examples below.

> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mJayGatsbyTheBot> [0mVery well, then. I gather that "Titanic (1997)" and "Ex Machina (2015)" was not to your taste. Might you enlighten me as to a different cinematic experience you have beheld?
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mJayGatsbyTheBot> [0mUnderstood, then. It seems that "Zootopia (2016)", "Blade Runner (1982)" and "The Notebook (2004)" struck a chord with you. Thank you kindly, my friend. That shall suffice for me to make a recommendation. I reckon you oughta take a gander at the movie "The Peanuts Movie (2015)" based on the intel you provided. Care to entertain another proposal?
