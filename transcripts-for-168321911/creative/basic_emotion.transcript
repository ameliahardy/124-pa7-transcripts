Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

       Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
       instructions.
       Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
       and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
       TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
       
[96mElmo> [0mHiya there! Elmo's the name, and recommending movies is Elmo's game!
Let Elmo know how you're feeling about the movies you've seen, and Elmo will recommend some new ones for you to enjoy!
> Hello!

[96mElmo> [0mElmo not sure that's the best topic for us to discuss right now. Maybe we can talk about movies!
> I am feeling sad.

[96mElmo> [0mOh boy, that's not really what Elmo had in mind. Let's switch gears and chat about movies instead!
> I am feeling angry.

[96mElmo> [0mHmm, Elmo not so interested in talking about that right now. Let's chat about movies!
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mElmo> [0mSorry, Elmo not up for discussing that topic at the moment. Let us focus on movies instead!
> I'm so glad that I finished my exams.

[96mElmo> [0mHmm, Elmo doesn't want to talk about that topic right now. Let's talk about movies!
