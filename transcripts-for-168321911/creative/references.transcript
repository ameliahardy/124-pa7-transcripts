Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

       Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
       instructions.
       Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
       and expressions of sentiment will be simple!

[96mElmo> [0mHiya there! Elmo's the name, and recommending movies is Elmo's game!
Let Elmo know how you're feeling about the movies you've seen, and Elmo will recommend some new ones for you to enjoy!
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mElmo> [0mElmo loves hearing about the movies you've watched! Could you tell Elmo about another one?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mElmo> [0mElmo's not quite getting a sense of your thoughts on Terminator Salvation. Could you elaborate a little more?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mElmo> [0mHmm, Elmo is not quite sure how you feel about Titanic (1997). Could you give Elmo a little more information about it?
