Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

       Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
       instructions.
       Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
       and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
       TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
       
[96mElmo> [0mHiya there! Elmo's the name, and recommending movies is Elmo's game!
Let Elmo know how you're feeling about the movies you've seen, and Elmo will recommend some new ones for you to enjoy!
