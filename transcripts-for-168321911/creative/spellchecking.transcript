Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

       Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
       instructions.
       Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
       and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
       TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
       
[96mElmo> [0mHiya there! Elmo's the name, and recommending movies is Elmo's game!
Let Elmo know how you're feeling about the movies you've seen, and Elmo will recommend some new ones for you to enjoy!
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mElmo> [0mI don't know much about The Notbook, could you tell me about another movie?
> Yes.

[96mElmo> [0mOh boy, that's not really what Elmo had in mind. Let's switch gears and chat about movies instead!
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mElmo> [0mI don't know much about Screm, could you tell me about another movie?
> No.

[96mElmo> [0mSorry, Elmo not up for discussing that topic at the moment. Let us focus on movies instead!
> :quit
[96mElmo> [0mAww, Elmo had such a great time recommending movies to you! 
Don't forget to grab some popcorn and enjoy the show! Bye-bye for now, friend!
