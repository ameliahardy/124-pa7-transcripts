[96mElmo> [0mHiya there! Elmo's the name, and recommending movies is Elmo's game!
Let Elmo know how you're feeling about the movies you've seen, and Elmo will recommend some new ones for you to enjoy!

[96mElmo> [0mElmo's a little unsure about how you feel about Titanic (1997). Can you provide Elmo with more details?

[96mElmo> [0mElmo loves learning about new movies, but Elmo doesn't know much about Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019). Can you tell Elmo about another movie?
