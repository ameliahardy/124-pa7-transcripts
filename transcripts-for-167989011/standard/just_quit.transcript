Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Hello! Welcome to the movie recommendation chatbot! Tell me some movies 
            that you like or dislike and I will tell you some movies that you might
            enjoy!!

            Please only review one movie at a time so we really know if you like it 
            or not. When you refer to a movie, place the title in quotes:

            I really enjoyed "Toy Story"

            We hope you like our chatbot!
