Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Hello! Welcome to the movie recommendation chatbot! Tell me some movies 
            that you like or dislike and I will tell you some movies that you might
            enjoy!!

            Please only review one movie at a time so we really know if you like it 
            or not. When you refer to a movie, place the title in quotes:

            I really enjoyed "Toy Story"

            We hope you like our chatbot!

[96mgirlybot> [0mIt seems that you have a positive opinion of "Titanic (1997)." Name another film!
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mgirlybot> [0mYou didn't like the film "Zootopia (2016)". That narrows it down a bit. When you can, please give me another film.
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mgirlybot> [0mIt seems that you have a positive opinion of "Tangled Ever After (2012)." When you can, please give me another film.
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mgirlybot> [0mInteresting. You were not a big fan of "Sleeping Beauty (1959)". What other film did you like or dislike?
> I liked "Mulan"


That's enough for me to make a recommendation...
