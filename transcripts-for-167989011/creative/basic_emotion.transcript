Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Heyyy!! I guess I'm a movie recommendation chatbot, but like, I'm also
            totally not a weird creepy robot. I don't say 'beep boop bop' or anything
            like that. Don't worry.

            So tell me about some movies you've watched and if you totally loved them
            or really hated them. Then I'll give you some movies you def should watch.

            It helps me if you put the movie in quotes, though, like:

            I thought "Toy Story" was super rad.
