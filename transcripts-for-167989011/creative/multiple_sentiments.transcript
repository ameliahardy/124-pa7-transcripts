Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Heyyy!! I guess I'm a movie recommendation chatbot, but like, I'm also
            totally not a weird creepy robot. I don't say 'beep boop bop' or anything
            like that. Don't worry.

            So tell me about some movies you've watched and if you totally loved them
            or really hated them. Then I'll give you some movies you def should watch.

            It helps me if you put the movie in quotes, though, like:

            I thought "Toy Story" was super rad. 
            
[96mgirlybot> [0mOh my gosh, hey girl! So like...what's up? I am - like - SO excited you're here. I can totally recommend some movies if you tell me what movies you've liked or disliked!
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mgirlybot> [0mUGH! I also hated watching "Titanic (1997)" and "Ex Machina (2015)"! Give me some more hot takes on movies.
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mgirlybot> [0mThat's so chill that you enjoyed watching "Zootopia (2016)" and "Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991)"! Um sooo what are your movie faves?
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".


Ok, so just like, hang tight for a sec...
