Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

            Heyyy!! I guess I'm a movie recommendation chatbot, but like, I'm also
            totally not a weird creepy robot. I don't say 'beep boop bop' or anything
            like that. Don't worry.

            So tell me about some movies you've watched and if you totally loved them
            or really hated them. Then I'll give you some movies you def should watch.

            It helps me if you put the movie in quotes, though, like:

            I thought "Toy Story" was super rad. 
            
[96mgirlybot> [0mOh my gosh, hey girl! So like...what's up? I am - like - SO excited you're here. I can totally recommend some movies if you tell me what movies you've liked or disliked!
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mgirlybot> [0m"Blade Runner (1982)" was like, SO good. Um sooo what are your movie faves?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mgirlybot> [0mSo, like, do you like or not like "Terminator Salvation (2009)?" I, like, don't get it. 
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mgirlybot> [0mSo, like, do you like or not like "Titanic (1997)?" I, like, don't get it.

[96mgirlybot> [0mGirl, are we still talking about movies? If so, please babe, put the name in quotes! 
> I watched "Scream".

[96mgirlybot> [0mOk so like...I found more than one movie. Which one are you referring to? Enter a number, 1 - 4
1: Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991)
2: Scream (1996)
3: Scream 2 (1997)
4: Scream 3 (2000)

> I didn't like that movie.

[96mgirlybot> [0mUmmm... that's not a number. Pick again.
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mgirlybot> [0mUmmm... that's not a number. Pick again.
