Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Hi, I'm your movie chatbot, MovieGenie. I can talk about movie recommendations, and please ask me about one movie at a time!
        You can input up to five movies that you like, and I'll find a movie that I think you would like.
        In starter mode, please put your movie in quotation marks! In creative mode, watch me transform into a Southern chatbot.
        You don't have to put titles in quotation marks and can only mention parts of a title in quotes. I'll guide you through the selection process!
