Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Hi, I'm your movie chatbot, MovieGenie. I can talk about movie recommendations, and please ask me about one movie at a time!
        You can input up to five movies that you like, and I'll find a movie that I think you would like.
        In starter mode, please put your movie in quotation marks! In creative mode, watch me transform into a Southern chatbot.
        You don't have to put titles in quotation marks and can only mention parts of a title in quotes. I'll guide you through the selection process!
        
[96mMovieGenie> [0mHowdy! My name's MovieGenie, a bot that suggests movies. I reckon I should ask you about your movie tastes. Come on, honey, tell me bout a movie you've seen and whether not you had a grand ol time watchin it.
> Hello!

[96mMovieGenie> [0mBless your heart, but I don't know what you mean. Please tell me about what movies you liked or disliked.
> I am feeling sad.

[96mMovieGenie> [0mAin't that wild!
> I am feeling angry.

[96mMovieGenie> [0mSugar, that ain't really what I had in mind. Let's go back to movies.
> I have been feeling down lately.
