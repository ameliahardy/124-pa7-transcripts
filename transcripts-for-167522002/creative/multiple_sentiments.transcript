Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Howdy, partner! We are gonna have a hog-killin' time figuring out the next movie you are going to watch. 
        Please tell me about 5 movies you have seen that were either an ace in the hole or a snake in your boot. 
        Make sure to include only one movie name per line and ensure the name of the movie is in quotes along with 
        the year of the movie in parentheses (if you don't do this you might end up swimming with the fishes). Once 
        I have the names of the movies you have watched, I will make you recommendations. Feel free to say yes if 
        you want to hear more recommendations or no if have had enough. Enough dilly dallying. Let's get to talking!
        
[96mCowboy Cap> [0mHowdy, I'm Cowboy Cap! After we speak, movies won't feel like the wild west anymore. Tell me the name and year of a movie you have seen.
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mWow I didn't know you didn't like "Titanic (1997)" and "Ex Machina" so much! Have you watched any other movies? 
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI'm glad "" and "Zootopia" is one of your favorite movies. What is another movie you have watched? I'm sorry to hear "" and "Scream" is not one of your favorite movies. What is another movie you have watched? 
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mBased on what you have told me, I think you would like "Halloween H20: 20 Years Later (Halloween 7: The Revenge of Laurie Strode) (1998)". Would you like more recommendations?
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"
