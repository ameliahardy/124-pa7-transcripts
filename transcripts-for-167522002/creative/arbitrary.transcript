Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Howdy, partner! We are gonna have a hog-killin' time figuring out the next movie you are going to watch. 
        Please tell me about 5 movies you have seen that were either an ace in the hole or a snake in your boot. 
        Make sure to include only one movie name per line and ensure the name of the movie is in quotes along with 
        the year of the movie in parentheses (if you don't do this you might end up swimming with the fishes). Once 
        I have the names of the movies you have watched, I will make you recommendations. Feel free to say yes if 
        you want to hear more recommendations or no if have had enough. Enough dilly dallying. Let's get to talking!
        
[96mCowboy Cap> [0mHowdy, I'm Cowboy Cap! After we speak, movies won't feel like the wild west anymore. Tell me the name and year of a movie you have seen.
> Hello!

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI'm sorry, you're barking up the wrong tree. I can't make a recommendation without a movie. What is a movie you have watched and loved or hated?
> I am a robot too.

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mEnough of peanut talk. Please make sure you include a movie and your opinion of that movie so I can give you a recommendation!
> What is your name?

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI know more about iPhones than I know about my name.
> Do you know anything about books?

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mThat's interesting, but I don't think you have given me a movie. Make sure you have placed a movie title in quotes!
> I loved Dan Jurafsky's latest lecture.

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI don't know the first thing about you feeling.
