Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Howdy, partner! We are gonna have a hog-killin' time figuring out the next movie you are going to watch. 
        Please tell me about 5 movies you have seen that were either an ace in the hole or a snake in your boot. 
        Make sure to include only one movie name per line and ensure the name of the movie is in quotes along with 
        the year of the movie in parentheses (if you don't do this you might end up swimming with the fishes). Once 
        I have the names of the movies you have watched, I will make you recommendations. Feel free to say yes if 
        you want to hear more recommendations or no if have had enough. Enough dilly dallying. Let's get to talking!
        
[96mCowboy Cap> [0mHowdy, I'm Cowboy Cap! After we speak, movies won't feel like the wild west anymore. Tell me the name and year of a movie you have seen.
> Hello!

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mThat's doggone crazy, but you forgot to give me a movie!
> I am feeling sad.

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mThat's doggone crazy, but you forgot to give me a movie!

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mThat's interesting, but I don't think you have given me a movie. Make sure you have placed a movie title in quotes!
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mThat's great to hear! It doesn't look like you have told me about a movie you have seen. Can you tell me about one?

> I am very angry.

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI'm sorry, you're barking up the wrong tree. I can't make a recommendation without a movie. What is a movie you have watched and loved or hated?
> I am now happy.

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mThat's interesting, but I don't think you have given me a movie. Make sure you have placed a movie title in quotes!

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mEnough of peanut talk. Please make sure you include a movie and your opinion of that movie so I can give you a recommendation!
> "Titanic (1997)" makes me afraid of ice.
