Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Howdy, partner! We are gonna have a hog-killin' time figuring out the next movie you are going to watch. 
        Please tell me about 5 movies you have seen that were either an ace in the hole or a snake in your boot. 
        Make sure to include only one movie name per line and ensure the name of the movie is in quotes along with 
        the year of the movie in parentheses (if you don't do this you might end up swimming with the fishes). Once 
        I have the names of the movies you have watched, I will make you recommendations. Feel free to say yes if 
        you want to hear more recommendations or no if have had enough. Enough dilly dallying. Let's get to talking!
        
[96mCowboy Cap> [0mHowdy, I'm Cowboy Cap! After we speak, movies won't feel like the wild west anymore. Tell me the name and year of a movie you have seen.
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI'm glad "Blade Runner" is one of your favorite movies. What is another movie you have watched?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI'm sorry, I'm not sure if you liked "Terminator Salvation". Tell me more about it.
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mI can't tell if you liked or disliked "Titanic (1997)". Can you tell me more about it please?
> I liked it.

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mThat's interesting, but I don't think you have given me a movie. Make sure you have placed a movie title in quotes!
> I watched "Scream".

[96mCowboy Cap> [0mWhich one did you mean? Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991) or Scream (1996) or Scream 2 (1997) or Scream 3 (2000)?
> I didn't like that movie.
