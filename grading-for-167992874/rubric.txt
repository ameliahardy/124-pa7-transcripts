Karson: I contributed a lot on the recommend function. Additionally, I worked over implementation of functions to fix small bugs in them that arose.
For example, I modified our find_movies function to ensure that we would correctly get the right indices.

Dorien: added the phrases with a rapper theme, helped with extracting movie/title names and making sure that they matched the users query. Aiding with anything needed for the other functions

Galen: I Built the framework for the process function including much of the initial dialogue. Wrote the extract_titles, extract sentiment and recommend function.

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

ANSWER: One important ramification of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems is that people may grow attached to these systems 
and feel as if they are forming a bonding connection. This connection would objectively be unhealthy and unstable because 
of the likelihood that the system can get modified or replaced at any moment by something better. One key way to avoid this issue 
would be to clearly warn users that what they are interacting with is a chatbot. This could help prevent someone from believing they 
are forming a bond with the system. Another issue that would arise with anthropomorphizing chatbot systems is that people may become too reliant 
on these systems in certain areas and have certain expectations that only humans might be able to meet. As mentioned earlier,
the best way to combat this issue would be to warn people that this is simply a piece of software that they are interacting with and that 
it's not capable of certain things.
