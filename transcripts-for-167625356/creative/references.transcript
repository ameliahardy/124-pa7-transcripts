Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        I can recommend movies to you if you tell me your feelings about
        a few of them. You can hit enter once you're done typing so I can 
        respond. Make sure to enclose the movie names in double quotes 
        if you're running in basic mode. 
        
[96mApril> [0mUm hi I'm April Ludgate, I'm only here because I get college credit for this. Tell me about your movie taste, or don't. I don't really care.
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mApril> [0mYou thought "Blade Runner" was pretty good? I didn't. How do you feel about another movie? I feel like going home.
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mApril> [0mI get it, you don't like "Terminator Salvation". Tell me about another movie, or don't. I don't care.
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mApril> [0mI don't get what you just said.
> I liked it.

[96mApril> [0mThere are multiple movies with the name "it", can you please just be more specific. Ugh.
> I watched "Scream".
