Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        I can recommend movies to you if you tell me your feelings about
        a few of them. You can hit enter once you're done typing so I can 
        respond. Make sure to enclose the movie names in double quotes 
        if you're running in basic mode.
