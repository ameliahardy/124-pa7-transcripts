TODO: Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

______________________ANSWER________________________
Chatbots that are anthropomorphized can give the impression that they 
have human-like intelligence and expertise. Users may expect the chatbot 
to provide accurate and personalized advice even in complex or nuanced situations 
as a result of this. When the chatbot fails to meet these expectations, users may 
become frustrated, disappointed, or misled. Furthermore, users may place too much 
trust in the chatbot's responses, even if the information provided is incorrect 
or incomplete. This can lead to users making decisions based on inaccurate 
information, which can have serious consequences in areas such as health, 
finance, and law.

Engineers can use design elements such as different fonts or colors, a robot icon, 
or a disclaimer to help users distinguish chatbot responses from those of humans. 
Chatbots can also express explicitly when they are unsure of a response or are unable 
to provide specific information. Engineers must consider the potential consequences 
of anthropomorphizing chatbots and take steps to ensure that users have reasonable 
expectations and can make informed decisions based on their responses.
