Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!

[96mmoviebot> [0mConfused, your words make me. Like Yes, Madam (a.k.a. Police Assassins) (a.k.a. In the Line of Duty 2) (Huang gu shi jie) (1985) did you, or not like it? Speak plainly, you must.
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mmoviebot> [0mNever heard of Screm I have. Other movies, you must give.
