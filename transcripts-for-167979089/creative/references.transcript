[96mmoviebot> [0mWatch movies, you must. From them, learn you will. Good taste in movies, have you? Hmmmm. Recommend great movies, I can.

[96mmoviebot> [0mA great movie, Blade Runner (1982) is. Enjoyed it, you did. What other movies spark joy, in you? Share with me, your favorites. Help you discover new movies, I will.
