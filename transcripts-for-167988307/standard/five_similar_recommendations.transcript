Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHi, I'm a movie reccomendation chatbot. To get started please tell me about some movies you've seen.
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mmoviebot> [0mSo you liked Titanic (1997). Tell me about another movie you've seen!
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mmoviebot> [0mSo you didn't like Zootopia. Tell me about another movie you've seen!
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mmoviebot> [0mSo you liked Tangled Ever After. Tell me about another movie you've seen!
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mmoviebot> [0mSo you didn't like Sleeping Beauty. Tell me about another movie you've seen!
> I liked "Mulan"
