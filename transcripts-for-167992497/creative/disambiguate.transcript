Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Welcome to the Chavo del Ocho Movie Chatbot! This is an engaging chatbot
        that can mainly help you find your next favorite movie recommendation!
        Just provide him with a few movies you've seen and tell him what you thought
        of them and magic will happen. Chavo is smart and can find movies even
        when you don't write them with the exact name. Exciting!
        
        But that's not all, Chavo can handle open ended conversation (you can tell
        him about your feelings) and many more!

movie that you have seen and whether or not you like it. Ah, just make sure to place the movie between
quotes so I can recognize it, por favor!
