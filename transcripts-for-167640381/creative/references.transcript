> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mDanimuraBot> [0mGlad to hear that you liked, 'Blade Runner' I am. Force I have, but need I must to hear about another movie.

[96mDanimuraBot> [0mSorry, I am! Understand, I do not. About a movie, please tell me -- put the title in quotation marks, you must!
> I watched "Scream".

[96mDanimuraBot> [0mHmm, found more than one movie called 'Scream' have I. Which one did you mean, I am wondering?
- Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991)
- Scream (1996)
- Scream 2 (1997)
- Scream 3 (2000)
Clarify the specific version you liked, I am hoping you will.
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mDanimuraBot> [0mClarification does not seem to match any movies, Yodabot is afraid. Try again I request.
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mDanimuraBot> [0mClarification does not seem to match any movies, Yodabot is afraid. Try again I request.
> And also "Ex Machina".
