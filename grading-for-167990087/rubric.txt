Frederic and Issac implemented starter mode features for non creative mode (e.g., extract_titles and extract_sentiment) and the 
starter mode process, as well as the recommend function.

Jaisal and Lukas implemented creative features for creative mode (e.g, extract_sentiment_for_movies and alternative titles) 
and implemented the creative process flow.

TODO: Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

We see negative ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems. For example, if a chatbot is used to
provide medical or financial advice, it could be dangerous if users believe the chatbot is a human. On the other side, 
there are benefits to humans receiving companionship from chatbots, which the believe to be human - see e.g., replica.ai 
or receiving customer support from chatbots e.g., kasisto for banking such as expediated service.

We believe that fine tuning chatbots to identify critical topics (e.g., medical advice) and providing
a disclaimer that the chatbot is not a human could help users distinguish between chatbot and human responses.
