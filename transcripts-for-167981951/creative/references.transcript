Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7

        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!

[96mDean> [0mHey there! I'm a Dean, a chatbot whose job it is to recommend you movies. Can you tell me a movie you've seen recently?

[96mDean> [0mSure, you vibed with "Blade Runner (1982)"! Tell me what you think of another movie.
