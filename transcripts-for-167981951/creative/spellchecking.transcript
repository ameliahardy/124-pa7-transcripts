Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mDean> [0mHey there! I'm a Dean, a chatbot whose job it is to recommend you movies. Can you tell me a movie you've seen recently?

> Yes.

[96mDean> [0mOk, you liked "The Notebook (2004)"! Tell me what you think of another movie.
