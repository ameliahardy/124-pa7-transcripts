Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mDean> [0mHey there! I'm a Dean, a chatbot whose job it is to recommend you movies. Can you tell me a movie you've seen recently?
> Hello!

[96mDean> [0mSorry, I only know how to talk about movies.
> I am feeling sad.

[96mDean> [0mHm, that's not really what I want to talk about right now, let's go back to movies.
> I am feeling angry.

[96mDean> [0mOk, got it.
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mDean> [0mOk, got it.
> I'm so glad that I finished my exams.

[96mDean> [0mOk, got it.
> I am very angry.

[96mDean> [0mHm, that's not really what I want to talk about right now, let's go back to movies.
> I am now happy.

[96mDean> [0mSorry, I'm not sure which movie you are referring to. Did you mean "Happy Gilmore (1996)" or "Happy Endings (2005)" or "Happy Accidents (2000)" or "Happy Feet (2006)" or "Happy (2011)"?
> I am ANGERED.

[96mDean> [0mOk. Moving on. Tell me about another movie!
> "Titanic (1997)" makes me afraid of ice.

[96mDean> [0mI'm sorry, I'm not sure if you liked "Titanic (1997)". Can you tell me more about it?
> I am VERY FRUSTRATED with this chatbot.

[96mDean> [0mI'm sorry, I'm not sure if you liked "Titanic (1997)". Can you tell me more about it?
> I'm anxious about everything.

[96mDean> [0mSure, you didnt enjoy "Titanic (1997)". Tell me what you think of another movie.
> Colorless green ideas sleep FURIOUSLY.

[96mDean> [0mHm, that's not really what I want to talk about right now, let's go back to movies.
> I HAAAATE movies.

[96mDean> [0mOk, got it.
> :quit
[96mDean> [0mHave a nice day!
