Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mDean> [0mHey there! I'm a Dean, a chatbot whose job it is to recommend you movies. Can you tell me a movie you've seen recently?
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mDean> [0mSo, you disliked "Titanic (1997)" and you didnt enjoy "Ex Machina (2015)". Tell me what you think of another movie.
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mDean> [0mOk, you grooved with "Zootopia (2016)" and you enjoyed "Cerro Torre: Schrei Aus Stein (1991)". Tell me what you think of another movie.
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mDean> [0mSo, you disliked "Zootopia (2016)" and you disliked "Eat Pray Love (2010)". Tell me what you think of another movie.
given what you told me, I think you would like "Stick It (1994)". Would you like more?
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"

[96mDean> [0mOk sounds good.
> :quit
[96mDean> [0mHave a nice day!
