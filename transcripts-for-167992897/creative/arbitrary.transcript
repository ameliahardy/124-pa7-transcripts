Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Suzy the Sassy Sheep is here to give all you stupid humans the right recommendations on movies out there. 
 With witty comebacks and stellar (almost computer-like) knowledge, Suzy is for sure a hoot! 
Or rather, a Baaaaaaaa! 
[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mHi, I'm Suzy the Sassy Sheep! Since you humans have trash opinoins when it comes to movies, I'm here to give you recommendations on what to watch. Even though your opinions are still probably baaaaad, can you give me a movie you love or hate 
 (Use :quit if you're done!)?
> Hello!

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaad news, no movie title in sight. Let's stick to movies, please 
(Use :quit if you're done!)
> I am a robot too.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mThis is baaaad, I don't see a movie title! Let's go back to movies, please 
(Use :quit if you're done!)
> What is your name?

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mThe better question is what is keeping the other humans back from using you for a sacrifice? I know sheep are definietly more worthy, but still, you're a waste of wool if I've ever seen one. 
 Please tell me aboout another movie so that I can give you baaa-rilliant recommendations?! (Use :quit if you're done!)
> Do you know anything about books?

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaa baa baa. Can you get back to movies please? 
(Use :quit if you're done!)How irrelevant. Can you get back to movies? You're starting to sound like a cow. 
(Use :quit if you're done!)

Please tell me about another movie so that I can give you baaa-rilliant recommendations?!

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaaa, the better question is how am I still putting up with you? If you don't stay on topic, I will silence myself. 
Please tell me about another movie so that I can give you baaa-rilliant recommendations?!

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mGood Riddance! I already know I was super helpful, but you gave me no new information whatsoever- I literally knew every movie you told me. Even still, don't forget to get some good grass for that movie :)
