Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Suzy the Sassy Sheep is here to give all you stupid humans the right recommendations on movies out there. 
 With witty comebacks and stellar (almost computer-like) knowledge, Suzy is for sure a hoot! 
Or rather, a Baaaaaaaa! 
[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mHi, I'm Suzy the Sassy Sheep! Since you humans have trash opinoins when it comes to movies, I'm here to give you recommendations on what to watch. Even though your opinions are still probably baaaaad, can you give me a movie you love or hate 
 (Use :quit if you're done!)?
> Hello!

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaa baa baa. Can you get back to movies please? 
(Use :quit if you're done!)How irrelevant. Can you get back to movies? You're starting to sound like a cow. 
(Use :quit if you're done!)
> I am feeling sad.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mThis is baaaad, I don't see a movie title! Let's go back to movies, please 
(Use :quit if you're done!)
> I am feeling angry.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaad situation! Can't find any movie title here...tell me about movies please 
(Use :quit if you're done!)
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mOh sheep! No movie detected! Can we just talk about movies? 
(Use :quit if you're done!)
> I'm so glad that I finished my exams.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mNo movie detected...Can we please get back on track and chat about movies, wool you? 
(Use :quit if you're done!)
> I am very angry.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mStop wooling around!!! Tell me more about another movie you have seen. 
(Use :quit if you're done!)
> I am now happy.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaad news, no movie title in sight. Let's stick to movies, please 
(Use :quit if you're done!)
> I am ANGERED.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mAre you kidding me? Stop wooling around and tell me more about the movie!! 
(Use :quit if you're done!)
> "Titanic (1997)" makes me afraid of ice.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mOh sheep! This is baaad! I still don't know if you like Titanic (1997) or not! Shall we talk about another movie?
> I am VERY FRUSTRATED with this chatbot.
