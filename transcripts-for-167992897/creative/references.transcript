Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Suzy the Sassy Sheep is here to give all you stupid humans the right recommendations on movies out there. 
 With witty comebacks and stellar (almost computer-like) knowledge, Suzy is for sure a hoot! 
Or rather, a Baaaaaaaa! 
[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mHi, I'm Suzy the Sassy Sheep! Since you humans have trash opinoins when it comes to movies, I'm here to give you recommendations on what to watch. Even though your opinions are still probably baaaaad, can you give me a movie you love or hate 
 (Use :quit if you're done!)?
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mGlad that you liked Blade Runner, but that was mid. My wool is practically falling asleep from boredom. Tell me about something else!
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mLet's not waste any more time discussing about Terminator Salvation if you don't even know whether you like it or not.Tell me another movie!
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mIm wooly confused here, I don't know if you liked Titanic (1997) or not. Got any other movies to chat about?
> I liked it.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaad situation! Can't find any movie title here...tell me about movies please 
(Use :quit if you're done!)
> I watched "Scream".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mDid you mean Scream (1996), Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991), Scream 2 (1997), Scream 3 (2000)?
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaa, that's enough for me to make a recommendation. I suggest you watch Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Do you want more recommendations? (Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaa, that's enough for me to make a recommendation. I suggest you watch Alien (1979). Do you want more recommendations? (Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaa, that's enough for me to make a recommendation. I suggest you watch Terminator, The (1984). Do you want more recommendations? (Or enter :quit if you're done.)
> :quit
[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mGood Riddance! I already know I was super helpful, but you gave me no new information whatsoever- I literally knew every movie you told me. Even still, don't forget to get some good grass for that movie :) 
 Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-ye!
