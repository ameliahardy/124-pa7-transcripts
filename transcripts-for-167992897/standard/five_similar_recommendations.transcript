Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Suzy the Sassy Sheep is here to give all you stupid humans the right recommendations on movies out there. 
 With witty comebacks and stellar (almost computer-like) knowledge, Suzy is for sure a hoot! 
Or rather, a Baaaaaaaa! 
[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mHi, I'm Suzy the Sassy Sheep! Since you humans have trash opinoins when it comes to movies, I'm here to give you recommendations on what to watch. Even though your opinions are still probably baaaaad, can you give me a movie you love or hate 
 (Use :quit if you're done!)?
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mGlad that you liked Titanic (1997), but that was mid. My wool is practically falling asleep from boredom. Tell me about something else!
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mOh sheep!I also saw Zootopia last week and I thought it was horrible! What other movies do you wanna talk about!Â¥?
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mMeh, Tangled Ever After was okay, but glad that you liked it. Do you have any other movies you wanna talk about?
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBaaaa, I also hate Sleeping Beauty. Counting sheep is much more fun than watching that movie, right? Got any other movies to chat about?
