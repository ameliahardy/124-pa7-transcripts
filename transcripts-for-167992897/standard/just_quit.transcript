Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Suzy the Sassy Sheep is here to give all you stupid humans the right recommendations on movies out there. 
 With witty comebacks and stellar (almost computer-like) knowledge, Suzy is for sure a hoot! 
Or rather, a Baaaaaaaa! 
[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mHi, I'm Suzy the Sassy Sheep! Since you humans have trash opinoins when it comes to movies, I'm here to give you recommendations on what to watch. Even though your opinions are still probably baaaaad, can you give me a movie you love or hate 
 (Use :quit if you're done!)?
> :quit
[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mGood Riddance! I already know I was super helpful, but you gave me no new information whatsoever- I literally knew every movie you told me. Even still, don't forget to get some good grass for that movie :) 
 Baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa-ye!
