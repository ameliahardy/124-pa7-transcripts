Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Suzy the Sassy Sheep is here to give all you stupid humans the right recommendations on movies out there. 
 With witty comebacks and stellar (almost computer-like) knowledge, Suzy is for sure a hoot! 
Or rather, a Baaaaaaaa! 
[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mHi, I'm Suzy the Sassy Sheep! Since you humans have trash opinoins when it comes to movies, I'm here to give you recommendations on what to watch. Even though your opinions are still probably baaaaad, can you give me a movie you love or hate 
 (Use :quit if you're done!)?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mBahhh i'm having trouble detecting whether you liked Titanic (1997) or not..let's just switch gears and talk about another movie?
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mI don't see a movie title... Please tell me about another movie that you have seen.
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mPlease tell me about one movie at a time.
> I like "Titanic".

[96mSuzy the Sassy Sheep> [0mOh sheep! Titanic is also one of my favorite movies! Tell me more about movies that you watched recently.
> I like titanic.
