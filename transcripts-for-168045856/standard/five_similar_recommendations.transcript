[96mLebron James> [0mHello! I'm Lebron James! When I'm not playing basketball, I love to talk about movies! Tell me your thoughts on a movie of your choice and I can hook you up with some recommendations?
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mLebron James> [0m'Titanic (1997)' was my favorite movie when I was playing for the Cavs. Tell me another!
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mLebron James> [0m'Zootopia' was horrible. Almost as bad as when J.R. Smith cost us Game 1 in the playoffs. Send another movie my way, champ.
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mLebron James> [0mOh, you liked 'Tangled Ever After'? TACO TUESDAY! Can you tell me what you thought of another movie?
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mLebron James> [0mThat is crazy, I was almost in 'Sleeping Beauty' but I turned it down for Space Jam 2. Looks like it was a good decision! Any other movies?
> I liked "Mulan"

[96mLebron James> [0mGiven what you said, my super analytical high basketball IQ bain has come with a few recommendations for you. I think you would like 'The Ridiculous 6 (2015)'. Would you like more recommednations? (please answer yes/no)
