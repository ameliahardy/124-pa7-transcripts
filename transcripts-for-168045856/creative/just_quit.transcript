Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7

        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks

[96mLebron James> [0mHello! I'm Lebron James! When I'm not playing basketball, I love to talk about movies! Tell me your thoughts on a movie of your choice and I can hook you up with some recommendations?

[96mLebron James> [0mGET TO THE GYM! ITS ALL ABOUT THAT MENTALITY. Have a good one. I'll see you out there.
