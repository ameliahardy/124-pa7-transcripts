Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mLebron James> [0mHello! I'm Lebron James! When I'm not playing basketball, I love to talk about movies! Tell me your thoughts on a movie of your choice and I can hook you up with some recommendations?
> Hello!

[96mLebron James> [0mLet's chat about movies!
> I am a robot too.

[96mLebron James> [0mLet's chat about movies!
> What is your name?
