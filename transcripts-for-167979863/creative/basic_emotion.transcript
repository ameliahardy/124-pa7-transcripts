Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Hello Thank you for using CleverChat, a movie recommender system.
        We have made our CleverChat bot sound like Master Yoda.
        You can interact with the Master by greeting him or telling him 
        how you are feeling. He is programmed to give unique responses based 
        on how the user is feeling. You will need to provide your feelings toward
        5 movies before a recommendation is given.
        Here are some examples:
        'I really like "8 Mile"'
        'I really hate "Poison Ivy"
        'I like "8 Mile" but hate "Poison Ivy"

        If there is more than one year when this movie was released the chatbot will give a 
        list of options. Feel free to clarify by putting in the whole title, the year, or 
        just specifying the index of what you mean (i.e first one, 1, 4 etc). 

        If you missspell a title our CleverChat will try and give you a variety of titles to 
        chose from to see if those are what you meant. 

        
        "Welcome, young Padawan! In search of movies, are you? Watchful eye, I shall be. Recommend, 
        I will. To find the right movie, the Force will guide us."
