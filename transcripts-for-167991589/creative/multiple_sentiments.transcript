> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mTony Hawk> [0mGot ya man, you didn't like Titanic (1997), and you didn't like Ex Machina, and I feel that way too man. What did you think of another movie?
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mTony Hawk> [0mGot ya man, you didn't like Zootopia, and you didn't like Eat Pray Love, and I bet you would like Women of '69, Unboxed. Let me know if you would like another rec!
