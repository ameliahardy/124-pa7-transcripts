[96mTony Hawk> [0mYo what's up? It's Tony Hawk. I have some gnarly movie recs for you, dude. Just hit me with what you thought about a movie?
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mTony Hawk> [0mAhhh yeah man! I see you liked Blade Runner! Can you tell me about another movie?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mTony Hawk> [0mYou were neutral toward Terminator Salvation. I felt the same, dude. Can you tell me about another movie?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mTony Hawk> [0mAhh dude. It seems that you were ambivalent toward Titanic (1997). Can you tell me how you felt about another movie?
> I liked it.

[96mTony Hawk> [0mAhhh yeah man! I see you liked it! Can you tell me about another movie?

[96mTony Hawk> [0mYou were neutral toward Scream. I felt the same, dude. Can you tell me about another movie?

[96mTony Hawk> [0mSorry dude, I didn't catch any movies mentioned there. Can ya tell me a movie that you liked?
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mTony Hawk> [0mAhh dude. It seems that you were ambivalent toward Zootopia. Can you tell me how you felt about another movie?

[96mTony Hawk> [0mAhh dude. It seems that you were ambivalent toward Ex Machina. Can you tell me how you felt about another movie?
