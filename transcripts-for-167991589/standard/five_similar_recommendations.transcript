Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

                Hi! I'm an interactive chatbot named Oscar! I can give you movie recommendations
                if you tell me 5 movies that you've seen and how you felt about them. This can
                be anything ranging from "I like this movie" to "I despised this movie" and
                anything in between. You can also specify how many movie recommendations you
                would like, and I can tell you that many movies that I think you'll like!
