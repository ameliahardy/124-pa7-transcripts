Michael and Alex built out the starter mode functionality. Michael also implemented movies without 
capitalization, alternate/foreign titles, and dialogues for spell-correcting/disambiguation. Alex
also implemented fine-grained sentiment extraction, and emotion responses. Gaurav and Hamzah 
worked on disambiguation and spell-correcting.

TODO: Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

  An anthropomorphized chatbot system could lead to significant job loss in many industries reliant on
human-human contact and personalized feedback; customer support and education are two that immediately come to mind. 
With anthropomorphized bots, the function of "live chat" can effectively be replaced, and tutoring/teaching as well. 
Moreover, broadly speaking, the world would become much more isolated in the sense that interactions are not as focused on
direct human contact. Reliance on chatbots would mean person-person interactions can be achieved online, and this may
lead to more isolation and thus issues such as slower behavioral growth and maturity in children.
  
  Engineers could ensure that chatbots using anthropomorphized characteristics are tagged with a special code and 
clear disclaimer. There may have to be some government legislation involved to make this a reality. Furthermore, 
anthropomorphization could be avoided entirely by engineers; chatbots could be required to pass a sentiment test where their 
language is different enough away from a human's before they can be rolled out. Engineers could ensure that their chatbots 
pass these marks before a bot is rolled out.
