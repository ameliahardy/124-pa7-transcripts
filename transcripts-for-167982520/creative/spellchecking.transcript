Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Sherlock bot will deduce the best movie for you! Give it your opinion of a movie and it will extract
        the sentiment. Ask for it to show you interesting movies or give you recommendations and it will 
        begin returning a list of possible movie recommendations! If you spell something wrong or give a vague title,
        no worries! Sherlock bot will help you clarify.
        
[96mSherlock Bot> [0mGreetings! How may I be of service!
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mI could not discover a movie named "The Notbook". I must ask for further elucidation. Which of these did you have in mind? Notebook, The (2004)?
> Yes.

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mFrom my observations, I deduce that you derived satisfaction from "Notebook, The (2004)", is that right? Pray, expound upon it further!
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mIt appears there are no movies named "Screm". 
Might I trouble you to specify which of these you had in mind? Scream (1996)?
> No.

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mMy deduction leads me to believe that you did not enjoy "Scream (1996)"? Elementary!
> :quit
[96mSherlock Bot> [0mWonderful, we shall meet again!
