Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Sherlock bot will deduce the best movie for you! Give it your opinion of a movie and it will extract
        the sentiment. Ask for it to show you interesting movies or give you recommendations and it will 
        begin returning a list of possible movie recommendations! If you spell something wrong or give a vague title,
        no worries! Sherlock bot will help you clarify.
