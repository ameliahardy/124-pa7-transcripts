Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Sherlock bot will deduce the best movie for you! Give it your opinion of a movie and it will extract
        the sentiment. Ask for it to show you interesting movies or give you recommendations and it will 
        begin returning a list of possible movie recommendations! If you spell something wrong or give a vague title,
        no worries! Sherlock bot will help you clarify.
        
[96mSherlock Bot> [0mGreetings! How may I be of service!
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mI deduce that you appreciated "Blade Runner (1982)", is that right? Elementary!
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mUnfortunately, I am unable to discern your opinion on "Terminator Salvation (2009)" What have you deduced about your enjoyment of it? Elementary!
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mI regret that I am unsure of how you feel about "Titanic (1997)"I would appreciate a more detailed account of your feelings on this matter, if you please. Splendid!
> I liked it.

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mI fail to see the relevance of that. Can we perhaps discuss movies instead?
> I watched "Scream".

[96mSherlock Bot> [0mApologies, there seems to be more than one movie named "Scream".  
Might I trouble you to specify which of these you had in mind? Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991), Scream (1996), Scream 2 (1997), Scream 3 (2000)?
> I didn't like that movie.
