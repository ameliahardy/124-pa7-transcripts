Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
        Walley is a movie recommending chatbot! Tell him about some movies you have seen and he can give you some 
        recommendations on what to watch next!"
        
[96mWalley> [0mHiya I'm Walley! What can I do for ya?
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mWalley> [0mAppreciate you giving me the details of not liking Titanic (1997)!Not every movie is a winner. I guess you didn't like Ex Machina!
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mWalley> [0mIsn't it great to find a movie you like. Glad you enjoyed Zootopia!Another great movie! And such a cool name! Scream!
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mWalley> [0mHate that you spent time watching a bad movie like Zootopia!Appreciate you giving me the details of not liking Eat Pray Love!
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"
