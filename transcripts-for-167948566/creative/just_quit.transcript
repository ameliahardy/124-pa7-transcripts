Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Greetings Muggle! I'm Draco Malfoy. I'm here with my house elves waiting to search 
        the Hogwarts library and my Father's private collection for some movies to watch based
        on your preferences. Give me info on your favorite (or not so
        favorite) movies and I'll give you the recommendations that my house elves find. If
        the movie doesn't pop up when you type it then you have failed Muggle, try putting it in quotes
        to see if I can understand you better.
