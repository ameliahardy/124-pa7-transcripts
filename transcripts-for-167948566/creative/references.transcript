Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Greetings Muggle! I'm Draco Malfoy. I'm here with my house elves waiting to search 
        the Hogwarts library and my Father's private collection for some movies to watch based
        on your preferences. Give me info on your favorite (or not so
        favorite) movies and I'll give you the recommendations that my house elves find. If
        the movie doesn't pop up when you type it then you have failed Muggle, try putting it in quotes
        to see if I can understand you better. 
        
        
[96mmovie_recommend_chatbot> [0mWelcome muggle! Let's try to make some movie magic!
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mmovie_recommend_chatbot> [0mOf course a muggle like you would enjoy "Blade Runner". Maybe something original?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mmovie_recommend_chatbot> [0mEven my father can not tell how you feel about "Terminator Salvation". Phrase that in a way that us upper class can understand.
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mmovie_recommend_chatbot> [0mMuggle I do not know how you feel about "Titanic (1997)". Maybe phrase it better...
> I liked it.

[96mmovie_recommend_chatbot> [0mSo you like "It". Well I guess you will never have the taste of my father and I. Tell me about a movie with some class.
> I watched "Scream".

[96mmovie_recommend_chatbot> [0mMuggle I do not know how you feel about "Scream". Maybe phrase it better...
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mmovie_recommend_chatbot> [0mYou're confusing me muggle. Try putting the movie in quotes!
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mmovie_recommend_chatbot> [0mEven my father can not tell how you feel about "Zootopia". Phrase that in a way that us upper class can understand.
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mmovie_recommend_chatbot> [0mMuggle I do not know how you feel about "Ex Machina". Maybe phrase it better...
> :quit
[96mmovie_recommend_chatbot> [0mFarewell Muggle! Hope you enjoy your movies.
