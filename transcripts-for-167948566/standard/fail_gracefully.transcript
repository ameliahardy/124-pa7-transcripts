Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Hey there! I'm here to help you find some movies to watch based
        on your preferences. Give me some info on your favorite (or not so
        favorite) movies and I'll give you a couple of recs at the end. If
        the movie doesn't pop up when you type it, try putting it in quotes
        to see if I can understand you better.

> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mmovie_recommend_chatbot> [0mCan you rephrase that? I am not sure how you feel about "Titanic (1997)".
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mmovie_recommend_chatbot> [0mThat doesn't sound like a movie to me. Any other ones that I might know?
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".
