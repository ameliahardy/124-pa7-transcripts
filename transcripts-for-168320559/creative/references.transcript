Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mWell hello there! My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know. I'm here to deduce the best movie recommendations for you! Let's get straight to business. Tell me about a movie. Spare no details!
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I liked "Blade Runner". in creative mode!! 

Splendid! You're a fan of Blade Runner.  To a great mind, nothing is little! Tell me about another movie
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed But not "Terminator Salvation". in creative mode!! 
 I see, but I cannot observe. I'm not sure whether you liked or disliked Terminator Salvation (2009). Is there any other movie to which you would wish to draw my attention!
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I saw "Titanic (1997)". in creative mode!! 
 I see, but I cannot observe. I'm not sure whether you liked or disliked Titanic (1997). Lend me more clues to the case! Tell me about another movie!
> I liked it.

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I liked it. in creative mode!! 
 After careful examination, there appear to be no movies in the clue you've given me. Why don't you tell me something about a movie?
> I watched "Scream".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mSeems like you may be talking about a couple of different movies here. Which one do you mean?
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I didn't like that movie. in creative mode!! 
 After careful examination, there appear to be no movies in the clue you've given me. Why don't you tell me something about a movie?
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I felt the same about "Zootopia". in creative mode!! 
 I see, but I cannot observe. I'm not sure whether you liked or disliked Zootopia (2016). To a great mind, nothing is little! Tell me about another movie
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed And also "Ex Machina". in creative mode!! 
 I have no data yet about whether or not you liked  Ex Machina (2015). My mind rebels at stagnation! Tell me about another movie
> :quit
[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mIt's been a pleasure solving your case. Now I must depart for yet another case. The game is afoot!
