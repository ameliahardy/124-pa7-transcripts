Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mWell hello there! My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know. I'm here to deduce the best movie recommendations for you! Let's get straight to business. Tell me about a movie. Spare no details!
> I saw "Titanic (1997)"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I saw "Titanic (1997)" in starter mode!! 
 I have no data yet about whether or not you liked  Titanic (1997). Is there any other movie to which you would wish to draw my attention!
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

 In all my years as a detective, I've never come across  Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019). My mind rebels at stagnation! Tell me about another movie
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You". in starter mode!! 
 Data! Data! Data! Too many movies in your clue! Tell me about just one of them!
> I like "Titanic".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I like "Titanic". in starter mode!! 

Let me jot that down in my fieldbook. You liked Titanic.  My mind rebels at stagnation! Tell me about another movie
> I like titanic.

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I like titanic. in starter mode!! 
 After careful examination, there appear to be no movies in the clue you've given me. Why don't you tell me something about a movie?
> I like "titanic".

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I like "titanic". in starter mode!! 

Splendid! You're a fan of titanic.  Lend me more clues to the case! Tell me about another movie!
> I like 10 things I hate about you.
