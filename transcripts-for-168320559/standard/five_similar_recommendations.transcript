Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mWell hello there! My name is Sherlock Holmes. It is my business to know what other people don't know. I'm here to deduce the best movie recommendations for you! Let's get straight to business. Tell me about a movie. Spare no details!
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I liked "Titanic (1997)" in starter mode!! 

Let me jot that down in my fieldbook. You liked Titanic (1997).  To a great mind, nothing is little! Tell me about another movie
> I hated "Zootopia"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I hated "Zootopia" in starter mode!! 

Noted. You are not a fan of Zootopia.  My mind rebels at stagnation! Tell me about another movie
> I liked "Tangled Ever After"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I liked "Tangled Ever After" in starter mode!! 

Let me jot that down in my fieldbook. You liked Tangled Ever After.  My mind rebels at stagnation! Tell me about another movie
> I hated "Sleeping Beauty"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I hated "Sleeping Beauty" in starter mode!! 

I observe that you did not like Sleeping Beauty.  My mind rebels at stagnation! Tell me about another movie
> I liked "Mulan"

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed I liked "Mulan" in starter mode!! 

Let me jot that down in my fieldbook. You liked Mulan. All obvious signs indicate that you'll like The Ridiculous 6 (2015). Would you like another recommendation?
> yes

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed yes in starter mode!! 
After intricate analysis, I believe you'd be a fan of "Pixels (2015)". Would you like another recommendation?
> yes

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed yes in starter mode!! 
After intricate analysis, I believe you'd be a fan of "World War Z (2013)". Would you like another recommendation?
> yes

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed yes in starter mode!! 
My many years as a detective tells me that you'll enjoy "Karate Kid, The (2010)". Would you like another recommendation?
> y

[96mSherlock HomieBot> [0mI processed y in starter mode!! 
After some serious deductions, I suspect you might like: "Not Another Teen Movie (2001)". Would you like another recommendation?
> y
