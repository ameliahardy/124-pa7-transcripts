Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?


Anthromorphizing chatbot systems can result in several consequences, both on individual and societal levels. Becoming personally attatched 
to a piece of software that is no more than that, software, creates an asymetrical relationship where the person is emotionally invested in 
something that is not there. On an individual level, recognizing chatbots as human entities can cause emotional distress and confusion in 
multiple ways. First, we can consider a case such as in the Black Mirror episode, "Be Right Back", where there is technology to bring back 
deceased people in digital form and the protagonist forms an attachment disorder. We see a combination of a person being attached to a non-human 
entity as well as the questionable moral stance of recreating a person who has existed, beyond when their lifespan ended. As we look at those who 
have passed, we generally consider their time here to be complete, rather than artificially extending it. For the person who is still alive, we have
the emotional cost of being attached to something that cannot actually return the affections shared. While each individual has the right to
hold attachments to who or what they want to, on a societal level, this could impact our ability to work with other people. Additionally,
while there are generally forms of advice that people may seek from other people but not chatbots, blurring this line makes it more difficult
to address. For example, if we're looking at the possibility of a person going to a chatbot for advice they might ask a therapist or doctor
about, given that those records are much less publicly available, a chatbot is unlikely to have the opinion and experience necessary to
safely answer these questions. Looking at ChatGPT, once it detects that a medical question is being asks, it directs people to speak with
a medical professional, rather than an electronic device. If this were not the case and people truly believed the other side of the chatbot
to be a human being, there could be the risk of grave harm. Engineers could help users distinguist responses from those of a human by 
establishing certain quirks. Some TAs have mentioned that when looking at student code as opposed to code generated by online software
or AI models, there tend to be small things that bots do which people would not. Similarly, we could intentionally ensure that programs
have these quirks, whether by asking the chatbot to overemphasis data received from places like the New York Times as opposed to Reddit, 
so in casual speech, it would be clearer that this is not a person, but rather some entity with a large database of information on written 
text.
