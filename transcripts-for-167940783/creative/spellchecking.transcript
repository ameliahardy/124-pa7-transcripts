Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        
        Meowy is a cat chatbot for all your cat-bot waifu dreams! Ask Meowy what you feel about various movies, and they will recommend you a movie!
