Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        This chatbot, CutieBot tries to get to know its users by prompting them
        for movies they liked and did not like. CutieBot first detects the names 
        of movies that are mentioned in the user's text. Then, it acknowledges 
        the negative or positive or neutral sentiment towards the movie that is 
        felt by the user. Finally, it tries to produce the best recommendation 
        for the next movie the user should watch.
