Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

                      This chatbot is designed to help users discover movies that match their 
                      interests and preferences. Tell our bot some information about a movie you
                      like or dislike, and the chatbot will use natural language processing to 
                      generate an appropriate movie recommendation list!

[96mFlixFinder> [0mI see, do you mind talking more specifically about your opinion of "Titanic (1997)"?
> I thought "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)" was a really great movie.

[96mFlixFinder> [0mHmm... I don't think I know "Dan Jurafsky and the Ten Dwarfs (2019)". Why don't we talk about a different movie instead?
> I like "Titanic (1997)" and "Scream" and "10 Things I Hate About You".

[96mFlixFinder> [0mI'm sorry, I am not capable to handle more than one movie at a time.
> I like "Titanic".

[96mFlixFinder> [0mThere's multiple movies called "Titanic". Which one do you want to talk about?
> I like titanic.

[96mFlixFinder> [0m I'm still not sure which you mean. Do you know the year it came out? Or the full title? That will help!
> I like "titanic".

[96mFlixFinder> [0mPlease tell me about a new film -- in quotation marks -- to continue :)
> I like 10 things I hate about you.

[96mFlixFinder> [0mPlease tell me about a film -- in quotation marks -- to get started :)
> Howdy.
