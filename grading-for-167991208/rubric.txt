TODO: Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

Anthropomorphizing chatbot systems can cause several possible ramifications. Chatbot systems doesn't necessarily
give the most accurate/reliable responses, and especially so when it comes to providing medical or financial advices.
Chatbot systems that are trained on biased data such as reddit or twitter can also say offensive or biased
things to users, causing damages to users' emotional wellbeing.

Engineers could use a toxicity detector to potentially mitigate offensive slurs outputed by the system. Or,
there can be a list of offensive keywords that are filtered out of the output texts produced by the bot. We can
also a disclaimer at the beginning of the conversation stating that the user is interacting with a chatbot. We can
also choose to use fonts that typically associated with machines (typesetters, etc.)
