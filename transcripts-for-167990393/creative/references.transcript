Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Meet our chatbot, Candace! Candace can help recommend a movie to you. Just
        tell her about a few movies you've either liked or disliked, and from that,
        she'll find a movie that you'll hopefully enjoy! A couple tips for talking
        to Candace: when you mention a movie, put it in quotes, such as "The Notebook"
        or "Avatar". If you know the year, that's also helpful for Candace to know! Just
        put it in parentheses after the title in quotes, such as "Titanic (1997)". Hope
        Candace is helpful to you!

[96mBritish Candace> [0m Did you enjoy "Terminator Salvation"? I'm not sure whether you did. Tell me more about it! 
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mBritish Candace> [0mSorry, mate. I still can't tell how you feel about Terminator Salvation, but it's okay. Why don't you tell me about a different movie?
> I liked it.

> I watched "Scream".

[96mBritish Candace> [0mSorry, mate. I'm still not sure which movie you're referring to, but it's okay. Why don't you tell me about a different movie?
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mBritish Candace> [0mRubbish! What other movies have you watched, and what did you think about them?
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mBritish Candace> [0m Did you like "Zootopia"? I'm not sure whether you did. Tell me more about it! 
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mBritish Candace> [0mSorry, mate. I still can't tell how you feel about Zootopia, but it's okay. Why don't you tell me about a different movie?
