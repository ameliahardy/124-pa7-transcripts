Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Meet our chatbot, Candace! Candace can help recommend a movie to you. Just
        tell her about a few movies you've either liked or disliked, and from that,
        she'll find a movie that you'll hopefully enjoy! A couple tips for talking
        to Candace: when you mention a movie, put it in quotes, such as "The Notebook"
        or "Avatar". If you know the year, that's also helpful for Candace to know! Just
        put it in parentheses after the title in quotes, such as "Titanic (1997)". Hope
        Candace is helpful to you!
        
[96mBritish Candace> [0m'Ello, mate! I'm Candace, originally from Newcastle, England. I'm here to recommend a bloody good movie to you today! Can you tell me about a movie you've seen before?
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mBritish Candace> [0mBlimey, you disliked watching "Ex Machina".  "Titanic (1997)" was pure rubbish. I did not enjoy it too.   Can you tell me about another movie now?
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mBritish Candace> [0mAlrighty, you enjoyed watching "Zootopia".   Blimey, I found multiple movies called "Scream". Could you clarify which one you're talking about bruv? Scream (1996), Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991), Scream 2 (1997), or Scream 3 (2000)?
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mBritish Candace> [0mSorry, mate. I'm still not sure which movie you're referring to, but it's okay. Why don't you tell me about a different movie?
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"

[96mBritish Candace> [0mAlrighty, you enjoyed watching "Zootopia".  Alrighty, you enjoyed watching "Blade Runner".  Ah yes, "The Notebook" is a bloody good movie! I liked it too.   Thanks mate, that's enough for me! You absolutely must check out "Doctor Who: The Time of the Doctor (2013)". Would you like to hear another recommendation? Or if you're done, you can enter :quit
> :quit
[96mBritish Candace> [0mIt's a wonderful day today, innit? I'll talk to you later, mate â€” I'm going to go get a cup of tea!
