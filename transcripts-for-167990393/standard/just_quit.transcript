Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Meet our chatbot, Candace! Candace can help recommend a movie to you. Just
        tell her about a few movies you've either liked or disliked, and from that,
        she'll find a movie that you'll hopefully enjoy! A couple tips for talking
        to Candace: when you mention a movie, put it in quotes, such as "The Notebook"
        or "Avatar". If you know the year, that's also helpful for Candace to know! Just
        put it in parentheses after the title in quotes, such as "Titanic (1997)". Hope
        Candace is helpful to you!
