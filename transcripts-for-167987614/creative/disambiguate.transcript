Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you Hamed?
> I liked "Harry Potter".

[96mmoviebot> [0mNot sure I know which one you meant out of Harry Potter - could you clarify?
> Chamber of Secrets

[96mmoviebot> [0mso you didn't like some movie... which one are you talking about?
> I liked "Harry Potter".
