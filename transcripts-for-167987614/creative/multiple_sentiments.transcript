Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you Hamed?
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mmoviebot> [0mDonâ€™t think Iâ€™m familiar with that one. Any others come to mind?
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mmoviebot> [0mCould you try again, this time just talking about one movie!
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mmoviebot> [0mOops, you might have been talking about multiple movies. Could you try again, just talking about one movie this time?
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"

[96mmoviebot> [0mI think you mightâ€™ve been talking about more than one movie. Try again, just one movie review at a time! 
> :quit
[96mmoviebot> [0mHave a nice day!
