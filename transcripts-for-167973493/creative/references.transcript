Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHow can I help you?
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mmoviebot> [0mCould you tell me about another movie you enjoyed?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm having trouble determining your opinion of Terminator Salvation, can you help me out?
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm not entirely sure whether you had a positive or negative reaction to Titanic (1997), could you explain further?
> I liked it.

[96mmoviebot> [0mYou've really thrown me for a loop! Could you elaborate or simplify it for me?
> I watched "Scream".

[96mmoviebot> [0mTo help me understand better, could you specify which Scream you're talking about?
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mmoviebot> [0mWow you stumped me! Can you either simplify or be more explicit?
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm not quite certain if you liked Zootopia or not, could you give me more information?
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mmoviebot> [0mI'm a bit confused about whether you enjoyed Ex Machina or not, could you give me more information to work with?
> :quit
[96mmoviebot> [0mHave a nice day!
