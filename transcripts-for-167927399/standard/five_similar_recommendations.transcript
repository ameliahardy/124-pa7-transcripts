Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mHi! I'm MovieBot! I'm going to recommend a movie to you. First I will ask you about your taste in movies. Tell me about a movie that you have seen.
> I liked "Titanic (1997)"

[96mmoviebot> [0mI see that you liked Titanic (1997). What's your opinion on another movie?
> I hated "Zootopia"
