Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        My name is CASS and I'm a chatbot designed to recommend movies. Tell me about movies you like or dislike and I'll help you find movies that you might enjoy!
        
[96mCASS> [0mI'm happy to recommend a movie for you! Please let me know about a movie you've viewed in the past.
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mCASS> [0mSorry, I couldn't quite catch what movie you were talking about. Could you tell me again or talk about another movie?
> Yes.

[96mCASS> [0mI'm sorry. I couldn't find a movie that corresponds to your input. Please try again! Try putting your movie in quotes or make sure your input is spelled correctly!
> I did not like "Screm"
