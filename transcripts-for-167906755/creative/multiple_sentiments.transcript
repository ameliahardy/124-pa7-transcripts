Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        My name is CASS and I'm a chatbot designed to recommend movies. Tell me about movies you like or dislike and I'll help you find movies that you might enjoy!
        
[96mCASS> [0mDo you like movies? I do! I want to recommend a movie for you, so please tell me about how you felt about a movie you've seen.
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mCASS> [0mI'll keep in mind that "Titanic (1997)" wasn't your favorite movie. "Ex Machina (2015)" must not have been to your liking! Please tell me about another movie!
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

1. Scream of Stone (Cerro Torre: Schrei aus Stein) (1991)
2. Scream 3 (2000)
3. Scream 2 (1997)
4. Scream (1996)
There are multiple movies that match your input. Out of these, which one did you mean?I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".
