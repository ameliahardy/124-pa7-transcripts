I worked on the recommend, binarize, similarity functions and the ethics portion.
I also worked on all of process's basic implementation and the following extensions:  communicating sentiment given multiple inputs
                                                                                   :  responding to arbitrary input
                                                                                   :  identifying and responding to emotions

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

Lack of accountability. Human beings, and in this case, professionals like psychologists are usually accountable for advice they give and 
what they say. Since chatbots are just systems, often not understandable like with neural networks, there is little accountability to what is said
and where it comes from which is dangerous. There is also the 'polarization' problem where a chatbot system can only help as much as it can, hence based on 
the domain and data it has been trained on. This means that anthropomorphizing it attributes a larger scope to its capabilities unreasonably, for instance 
a human psyhcologist can notice and assist with diagnoses like anxiety while handling someone with depression but a chatbot trained specifically for depressison
might not pick up on that because its scope is limited to the domain of anxiety and that alone.

There have been news about software systems that use text from a system itself to determine whether it was generated by an AI system which seems like an interesting idea.
