Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mH-hewwo! It's Chatty here, and I'd love to like, suggest a movie for you, nya~! B-before we get started though, could you t-tell me a little bit about your movie preferences? Maybe, umm, you could tell me about a movie you've seen before, owo? Then I can like, recommend something that I think you'll really enjoy, heheh~!
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mmoviebot> [0mUm, p-please don't be mad at me, but did you maybe misspell the movie title, nya? Could you please try again, hehe?
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[]
[96mmoviebot> [0mNo way, I've never heard of "Zootopia but not Scream" before! I'm sorry, but I don't think I can recommend anything for that movie, nya. Maybe you could tell me about another movie you've watched, owo?
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".
