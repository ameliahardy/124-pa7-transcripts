Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mH-hewwo! It's Chatty here, and I'd love to like, suggest a movie for you, nya~! B-before we get started though, could you t-tell me a little bit about your movie preferences? Maybe, umm, you could tell me about a movie you've seen before, owo? Then I can like, recommend something that I think you'll really enjoy, heheh~!
> Hello!

[25, 2279, 2365, 5134]
[4778, 8736, 9076]
[96mmoviebot> [0mOh my, hehe! I'm so sorry to ask, but could you please tell me the exact title of the movie you're referring to? I found multiple movies with the title "Hello" in my database, and I want to make sure I have the right one, owo! 
 
 Include one of these: [Hello, Dolly! (1969), Hello Ladies: The Movie (2014), Hello, My Name Is Doris (2016),]^_^
> I am a robot too.

[96mmoviebot> [0mNo way, I've never heard of "I am a robot too" before! I'm sorry, but I don't think I can recommend anything for that movie, nya. Maybe you could tell me about another movie you've watched, owo?
> What is your name?
