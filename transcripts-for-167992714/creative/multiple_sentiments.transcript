Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        This is the SUPER MOVIEBOT. This movie bot will ask the user for an input 
        of movies & the user's opinion on it! After 5 or more data inputs, the moviebot
        will automatically ask the user if they want a ~JUICY~ recommendation! Enjoy!

> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mGordon Ramsey Bot> [0mCrikey, you do not like "Titanic (1997)" and "Ex Machina". You absolutely like movies, right! Tell me more about another movie!
