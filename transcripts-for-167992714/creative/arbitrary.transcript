Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        This is the SUPER MOVIEBOT. This movie bot will ask the user for an input 
        of movies & the user's opinion on it! After 5 or more data inputs, the moviebot
        will automatically ask the user if they want a ~JUICY~ recommendation! Enjoy!
