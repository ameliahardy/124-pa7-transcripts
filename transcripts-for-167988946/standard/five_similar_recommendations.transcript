Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Bert is a movie recommender bot who can give you movie recommendations based on your personal taste. After you 
        talk about 5 movies (at minimum), Bert will start giving you movie recommendations. 
        Make sure to include the title of the movie in quotes. If you need to correct Bert's evaluation of your opinion of
        a movie, you can do so. 
        
[96mBert> [0mHey there, I'm Bert, a movies recommender bot.
