Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

Anthropomorphizing chat bots can give humans a false sense of trust in the bot since it sounds like what they say is coming from another human. Although they may have human-like emotions, chatbots are still machines that operate based on preprogrammed algorithms. This could become an issue in the case where humans become overly reliant on information from chatbots, even though these systems do not have the same decision-making skills as humans. 
To make sure that users can distinguish chatbot responses from human ones, engineers could make sure that the systems are properly branded and advertised. Having icons that always indicate that this is a chatbot response would help ensure that people know they are interacting with a machine. They could also engineer the bot to talk a certain way that is distinct from regular conversation. This, for example, could mean that they avoid colloquialism and idioms.
