[96mmoviebot> [0mWhat up, what up! This is MovieBot in the house! I gotchu covered with some lit movie recommendations, but first let me get a feel for your vibe. Can you tell me about a movie you've seen and what you thought of it? That way I can get a sense of your taste in flicks.
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mmoviebot> [0mAyyye, that's what's up, my homie! I'm stoked to hear that you're feelin' "Blade Runner"! What other flicks you into?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".
