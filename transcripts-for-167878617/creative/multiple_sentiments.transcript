[96mmoviebot> [0mWhat up, what up! This is MovieBot in the house! I gotchu covered with some lit movie recommendations, but first let me get a feel for your vibe. Can you tell me about a movie you've seen and what you thought of it? That way I can get a sense of your taste in flicks.
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".
