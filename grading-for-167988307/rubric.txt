  Ryan, Josh and Will were the main contributers to the code as well as a lot of collaboration on math and ethics. All work was split relatively evenly.

  We had a teammate Natasha join late and as such did not contribute as much to the final project.

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

Anthropomorphizing chatbot systems could have a number of ramifications, though not all need be negative.One obvious consequence would be the inreased data privacy concerns given that anthropomorphizing the chatbot would lead to a greater sense of connection and more willingness to disclose highly personal information. On the other hand, a more positive byproduct of anthropomorphizing could be the combattance of depression, anxiety, loneliness and a host of other mental health struggles by convincing the client that they are interacting with and being understood by a conscious agent. There are certainly ways that engineers could degrade chatbot repsonses such that they are clearly distinguishable from human reponses, but this would not necessarily be a good thing (for reasons outlined above). We feel that a balanced solution would involve retaining the human-like responses while occasionally interjecting with a comment indicating a lack of consciousness (i.e. "but I am merely a computer, so perhaps you should ask someone else.")
