TODO: Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

Anthropomorphizing chatbots can make humans feel especially trustful and vulnerable to these chatbots, which
can have unhealthy effects if it goes too far. For example, the human can grow too dependent on these chatbots
as support systems when there may be better ways to seek help when they need it. Additionally, chatbots do not 
fully understand human emotions and intentions, so they may not be the best sounding board for other humans as
it can lead to many misunderstandings. Engineers can ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses
from those of a human by reminding the human that they are speaking to a chatbot who has no true understanding of
the human experience. This can be established in the beginning of the chat and throughout the chat. It could also
be a good idea for chatbots to not convey any sort of emotional response, since they don't have emotions.
