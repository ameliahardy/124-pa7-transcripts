Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Your task is to implement the chatbot as detailed in the PA7
        instructions.
        Remember: in the starter mode, movie names will come in quotation marks
        and expressions of sentiment will be simple!
        TODO: Write here the description for your own chatbot!
        
[96mmoviebot> [0mDear reader, the social season is upon us. It is I, Lady Whistledown, and today I shall recommend to you a moving picture, a movie as they say nowadays.
 I must know what movies have pleased you so that I am able to make a most appropriate reccommendation. Would you please write about a movie that you have enjoyed?
