Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Below is an experimental Dr. Seuss chatbot. It understands movie titles in quotes, but you'll probably have to work a bit to understand its responses. That's the joy of Dr. Seuss!
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh me, oh my! What wonderful day! I'm a Dr. Seuss chatbot and I would like to say: do you have a dearest flick, a cinematic pic?
> Hello!

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh dear, my ears must be deceiving! Which movie, my friend, were you speaking?
> I am feeling sad.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mPardon me, my memory's hazy, which movie was it, my dear daisy?
> I am feeling angry.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mSorry, can't guess the show you mean. Could you expand on it, dear, or intervene?
> I have been feeling down lately.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mPardon me, my memory's hazy, which movie was it, my dear daisy?

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mPardon me, my memory's hazy, which movie was it, my dear daisy?
> "Titanic (1997)" makes me afraid of ice.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Titanic (1997)." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> I am VERY FRUSTRATED with this chatbot.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Titanic (1997)." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> I'm anxious about everything.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh dear, oh dear, it's sad to say, That "Titanic (1997)" left me feeling gray! Underwhelming, that's the word, It didn't quite hit the right chord! Oh gracious me, what other films have you viewed, That have left you feeling completely renewed? Have you watched a drama that tugged at your heartstrings, Or a thriller that had you on the edge of your seat, like springs?
> Colorless green ideas sleep FURIOUSLY.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh dear, my ears must be deceiving! Which movie, my friend, were you speaking?
> I HAAAATE movies.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mSorry, can't guess the show you mean. Could you expand on it, dear, or intervene?
> :quit
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHave a nice day!
