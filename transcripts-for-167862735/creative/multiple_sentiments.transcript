Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Below is an experimental Dr. Seuss chatbot. It understands movie titles in quotes, but you'll probably have to work a bit to understand its responses. That's the joy of Dr. Seuss!
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh me, oh my! What wonderful day! I'm a Dr. Seuss chatbot and I would like to say: do you have a dearest flick, a cinematic pic?
> I didn't like either "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh my, oh me, it's not too great, To find "Titanic (1997)" or "Ex Machina" didn't quite rate! Underwhelming, that's how I found, It didn't quite leave me spellbound! What other wondrous films have caught your eye, And left you feeling like you could just fly? Have you seen a tale of love or of war, Or a comedy that left you rolling on the floor?
> I liked "Zootopia" but not "Scream".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh happy day, oh happy day, To hear you love "Zootopia" and "Scream", what can I say? I'm over the moon, I'm floating on air, That we both have this love to share! Pray tell, my dear, what other flicks do you have thoughts on? Any picks? Let's hear your thoughts, let's hear your voice, On other films, your heart's true choice.
> I hated "Zootopia" and also "Eat Pray Love".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mA movie you'll fancy, I do decree! End of the Spear (2005), the one you should really go see! Would you like to hear another cinematic gem. perhaps?
> I liked "Zootopia", "Blade Runner", and "The Notebook"

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh me, oh my, it was so delightful, to talk with you about your favorite titles.
> :quit
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHave a nice day!
