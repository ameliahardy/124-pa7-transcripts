Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Below is an experimental Dr. Seuss chatbot. It understands movie titles in quotes, but you'll probably have to work a bit to understand its responses. That's the joy of Dr. Seuss!
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh me, oh my! What wonderful day! I'm a Dr. Seuss chatbot and I would like to say: do you have a dearest flick, a cinematic pic?
> I liked "The Notbook".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh what a joy, oh what a thrill, To hear "The Notbook" has such an incredible skill! It's great, it's fantastic, it's simply divine, A movie like that, is worth every dime! Oh gracious me, what other films have you viewed, That have left you feeling completely renewed? Have you watched a drama that tugged at your heartstrings, Or a thriller that had you on the edge of your seat, like springs?
> Yes.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mSorry, can't guess the show you mean. Could you expand on it, dear, or intervene?
> I did not like "Screm"

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Screm." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> No.
