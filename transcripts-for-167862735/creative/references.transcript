Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.
Below is an experimental Dr. Seuss chatbot. It understands movie titles in quotes, but you'll probably have to work a bit to understand its responses. That's the joy of Dr. Seuss!
[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh me, oh my! What wonderful day! I'm a Dr. Seuss chatbot and I would like to say: do you have a dearest flick, a cinematic pic?
> I liked "Blade Runner".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mMy heart is aflutter, my spirits are high, To know that you love "Blade Runner", oh me oh my! I'm thrilled, I'm delighted, I'm tickled pink, That we share this love, don't you think? Oh gracious me, what other films have you viewed, That have left you feeling completely renewed? Have you watched a drama that tugged at your heartstrings, Or a thriller that had you on the edge of your seat, like springs?
> But not "Terminator Salvation".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Terminator Salvation." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> I saw "Titanic (1997)".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Terminator Salvation." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> I liked it.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mI'm beaming with joy, I'm grinning with glee, To hear that "Terminator Salvation" is loved by you and me! I'm thrilled, I'm ecstatic, I can't contain, The happiness I feel, it's simply insane! What other wondrous films have caught your eye, And left you feeling like you could just fly? Have you seen a tale of love or of war, Or a comedy that left you rolling on the floor?
> I watched "Scream".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Scream." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> I didn't like that movie.

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mOh my, oh me, it's not too great, To find "Scream" didn't quite rate! Underwhelming, that's how I found, It didn't quite leave me spellbound! And now, my friend, the time has come, To speak of other films, not just this one. Are there more tales you'd like to tell? Of movies good, or not so well?
> I felt the same about "Zootopia".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Zootopia." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> And also "Ex Machina".

[96mDr. Seuss> [0mHmm. I'm not sure exactly what you thought of "Zootopia." Tell me a little more about what it made you feel.
> :quit
