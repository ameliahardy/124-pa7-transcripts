Vardhan Agrawal - worked on dialogue for spell-checking, dialogue for disambiguation, communicating sentiments 
and movies given multiple-movie input, responding to arbitrary input, identifying and responding to different emotions, and 
disambiguation part 1. Also made improvements to process function and tested a significant number of edge cases.

Paul Duggan - worked on extracting sentiment for multiple movies, finding titles close to a given misspelled title,
working on disambiguation and added datastructures to hold titles efficiently. Also built article handling for
alternaitive titles.

Jason Chao & Marco Pizarro: Pair-programmed all of Starter Mode. Built/modified REPL loop for both Starter and Creative.
Fixed several major bugs to ensure creative and starter modes passed necessary tests. Added randomness to responses to make chatbot
more human-like.

TODO: Please answer the following question:

Humans are quick to anthropomorphize chatbots, like ELIZA. 
In the 1960’s, users’ trust in ELIZA raised numerous concerns that humans would believe the system’s advice, 
even if ELIZA did not actually know what it was talking about. Newer chatbots are built using neural networks, 
like those you implemented in PA5. These neural networks are trained on enormous sets of data, from online 
sources like Reddit and Twitter. These sources are interlaced with offensive text that are often reproduced 
in chatbot responses. Furthermore, the newest advanced models, like GPT-3, have produced responses that appear 
that they were written by a human.

What are some possible ramifications of anthropomorphizing chatbot systems? Can you think of any ways that 
engineers could ensure that users can easily distinguish the chatbot responses from those of a human?

If users start attributing human-like qualities to chatbots, they may start to believe that the chatbot is capable of
tasks beyond its actual abilities, or even that they are sentient. Engineers could making clear that the user is
interacting with a chatbot: Chatbots could be programmed to introduce themselves as such at the beginning of a conversation,
or to use specific language or phrases that make it clear that they are not human. Given the public's experience with ChatGPT
however, it seems unlikely that users will be able to distinguish between a chatbot and a human from the outputted text
alone since given clever prompt-engineering users have been able to escape (or reveal) the bounds of the bot's
master/original prompt.
