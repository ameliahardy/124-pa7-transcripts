Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Welcome to our World-Wide-West themed Chatbot! Once you tell Cowboy Buster
        how you felt about five movies, he'll politely suggest a few movies that you might like.
        In creative mode, you should be able to speak about these movies without worrying about
        perfect spelling, quotations and/or capitalization.
