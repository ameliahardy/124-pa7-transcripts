Welcome to Stanford CS124's Chatbot Autograding.

        Hello! Welcome to the movie recommender bot. I am here to help you find new movies 
        you will enjoy. Please provide your option of 5 movies, one at a time, with movie 
        titles in quotations and I will provide a recommendation. If you wish to continue, 
        your subsequent entries will accumulate on the previous or start fresh otherwise. 
        Enjoy!
